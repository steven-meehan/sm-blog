Harrison waited for Lucas to place his next piece before he answered. "I'm not sure the world is ready for the devastation that something like that would bring."

"Well don't make it as devastating then, Harrison. But something that could replace a crossbow would give you freedom."

Harrison shrugged his shoulders as he replied, "Maybe."

The two friends finished placing their pieces in silence. But before Lucas could make his first move the study door opened. And a pair of servants opened the door and brought in the refreshments. The first placed a plate overflowing with dried meats, cheese, and sliced bread on the desk. And the second two goblets and a carafe of red wine next to the food before they both bowed and left the study. Once the servants were out of his study, Harrison poured some wine into each of their goblets. Lucas took one of the goblets and drank a sip and made his first move. "So what are you going to do?"

"I don't know, Lucas," Harrison said as he examined the board.

"Well do you want to return to the parade?"

Harrison laughed dryly, as he thought about his move. "No, I don't want to return to the parade."

"It wasn't all that bad Harrison."

Shaking his head at Lucas' comment, Harrison made his move, forming a new line of three stones. With a smile, Harrison removed another of Lucas' stones. "Yes, it was Lucas."

Lucas groaned at the move and took a swig of his wine. "I should have expected that." Lucas watched as Harrison's smile began to fade. "Why are you frowning? You removed another of my pieces. Not to mention that you set yourself up for the rest of the game."

"I just realized why my father was parading me through the noblemen."

"Wasn't it to find relics to duplicate?

Harrison shook his head as he drank some of his wine. "That was definitely part of it."

"So what was the real reason?" Lucas asked as he made his next move.

"He was hoping that one of the nobles would consider me a good match for their daughters." Harrison said as he removed another of Lucas's pieces.

"And for you the socializing that you did between your visits was harrowing." Lucas commented as he made his next move.

Nodding Harrison looked at his friend’s mirth and gently demanded. “Enough of the banter Lucas, skip to the real reason why you came today.”

“Fine,” Lucas began as he slumped into his chair. “You were always a little too direct for my taste Harrison.” But under Harrison's stern look, Lucas shrugged his shoulders and went on. “There is a gala coming up, and I’ll be taking my betrothed.”

“Good for you, Lucas.” Harrison said, but when his friend remained silent, he prompted his friend to finish with a sharp hand motion. “But why are you banging on my door?”

Harrison bobbed his head back and forth for a long moment, but he eventually answered. “Well she has a younger sister, and I do believe…”

Putting up his hand Harrison cut his friend off, “Lucas I’m not interested.”<hr class="clear-both center-fade"/><p class="center">[Previous Part](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-4) | [Page 1](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/) | [Page 2](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/2) | <span class="current-page">***Page 3***</span> | [Page 4](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/4) | [Page 5](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/5) | [Page 6](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/6) | [Page 7](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/7) | [Page 8](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-5/8) | [Next Part](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/part-6)</p>
