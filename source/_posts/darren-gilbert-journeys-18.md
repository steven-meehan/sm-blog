From the moment Maxwell dumped Wayne with his former roommate, Darren does everything he can think of to avoid his arrogant and distant relative. As the weeks churn, he alters every aspect of his life except for his classes. The teachers refuse to make further alterations to their classes to accommodate the childish behavior. With that avenue removed from him, Darren continues to isolate himself from Wayne and his classmates. So, the rumors of a new student never reach Darren’s ears.<!-- more --> One day Wayne joins Darren in the cafeteria to inquire if Darren heard about the Academy’s latest arrival. Will Darren tolerate Wayne’s current intrusion? Or will he storm off never to meet the new student?

“Have you met the newest student to grace the Academy?”

Darren slumped into the chair and ran a fork through his food. He scooped up a forkful and lifted it to his lips, but groaned and dropped the utensil. Darren shoved the dish toward the center of the table. “Wayne, I’m fairly certain we agreed that you wouldn’t bug me,” his eyes flicked up, “ever.”

Wayne smirked and slid into a seat across from Darren. “We arranged nothing of the sort.” He snatched a piece of toast and took a mouthful. Wayne laid the bread down, positioned a steaming glass under his nose, and peered over the rim. “Though with effort, I seem to remember you mumbling something about that nonsense. But since we’re family, I assumed I was supposed to ignore those musings.” He scooted closer and tightened his grip upon the cup.

As steam wafted into Wayne’s face, he took a deep breath. “However, that’s a matter for future discussion.” Wayne sipped his drink and laid it down, “For now, answer the question.”

“Wayne, we’ve discussed this relentlessly,” Darren rose, grabbing his plate and mug. “Despite being roommates and family, the idea of being around you makes me sick.”

“She’s a gorgeous elf.”
