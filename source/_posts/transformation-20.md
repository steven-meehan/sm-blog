Olyver threw the Chairman’s doors open and stormed inside, rushing to Caitlin. He ignored Quinn and slammed a tablet onto her desk. “What’s the meaning of this?!”

Quinn leaned over and plucked the pad up and skimmed through the file. He handed it to Caitlin and crossed his legs, placing his hands on his thigh. “That’s a document stipulating the Federation’s plans to shift our focus from colonization to defense.”

“I wasn’t talking to you,” Olyver whirled toward Quinn, jabbing his finger against the man’s chest. “You would do well not to interrupt important conversations.”

“You’re bruising the vice chairman of the new federation.” Caitlin moved the pad to the edge of her desk and placed her chin into her palm, taking a deep breath. “You realize that what you just did can be construed as assault. I recommend you control yourself, unless you prefer security forcibly dragging you out and throwing you out on your butt.”

Olyver straightened as rage and frustration rippled across his face. He took several breaths, grabbed a chair, dragged it over to the desk, and dropped into it. “Caitlin, we had an arrangement to focus our resources and efforts into expanding this new federation.”

“No,” Caitlin answered. “You may have believed that we came to that agreement, but we never did.” Caitlin lifted a small stylus and twirled it in her fingers. “My primary concern has always been the safety of this fledgling alliance of planets. And before we rush into the unknown, we’re going to build a proper military to protect the citizens who want to establish themselves on distant worlds.”
