Rylan paused on the street, studying the outlines in the storefront. After a brief examination of the reflection, he recognized the three shapes. He pressed his lips together and ran a hand through his hair as he touched the glass. He let his eyes linger on the translucent reflections while he took a series of deep breaths. Rylan rolled his head and tapped his fist against the smooth surface.

He scrunched his face and resumed walking. When he passed the entrance, Rylan darted down the alley on his left searching for a doorway. Halfway down the lane Rylan found one and stepped into it, wrapping the shadows around him. He peered over the doorframe and waited for his pursuers to follow.

When the initial stranger entered the backstreet, he leaned against the building and tapped his fingers against his arm.

When the second sauntered into the alley, he shoved the last one down the lane, “I thought this guy was a washed-up technician?”

“And fifteen years ago he was,” the initial man spat as he pushed off the wall. “But we didn’t exactly keep in touch after we returned from Laria.” He shoved both thick necked men down the alley and cupped his hands around his mouth, “Rylan, let’s have a conversation like civilized people?”

Rylan sighed and stepped out of his patch of shadows and waived at the trio. “Evan, why are you following me?”
