After rushing to complete my [second challenge](/archives/2020/09/03/questions) for this year’s NYC Midnight [Flash Fiction competition](http://www.nycmidnight.com/competitions/ffc/challenge.htm), I took a breath and turned to World of Warcraft to unwind. The game, coupled with life, helped September, much like the rest of the year, fly right past me. Thankfully, I saw the end of the month coming and pulled the genres to the forefront of my mind. First up was the Crime Caper, and I dusted off the notes I made for the tale when the poll closed and sketched out its skeleton.<!-- more -->

With the foundation of the tale entrenched in my mind, I took a slight break. When I returned this Crime Caper, the characters jumped to life, and I watched the narrative unfolded before me. And with that, I have another pair of characters that I’m excited about. With their backgrounds, I’m eager to return and flesh them out. Take a sneak peek at the tale and hurry on to the full story over at my Patreon site.

A seasoned thief has procured the services of a reckless youngster. Will this unlikely pairing bear fruit? Or will their efforts fail...

As a shadow slid down the home’s exterior wall, Alistair groaned and tapped his earpiece. “Dexter, I spliced the disruptor into the power line last night, don’t worry about disabling the security system.”

The shadow stopped moving and hung just above the window, Alistair identified as the entry into the mark’s study. “You chose me, so allow me to perform my job.”

Alistair rolled his eyes and banged his forehead, “Dexter, you have never had access to the tools I am providing you.” With a shake of his head, Alistair leaned against the wall of the neighboring home. “The window you’ve taken an eternity to enter is vulnerable for the foreseeable future. You don’t have to worry about tripping any alarms, so please get your act together and proceed with your infiltration.”

The shadow swayed and circled the glass opening, “Weren’t you just telling me about the importance of patience?”

Alistair’s teeth ground as he glared across the lawn at his partner. His fingernails dug into his palms as he inched toward the building, “At the time, I was teaching you how to correctly lift someone’s identification.”
