With the ever looming danger the world possesses and no allies, Tarian shifts his focus to the dead creature that attacked him. He arranged for the brightest people to delve into the mysteries the body can illuminate. Over the course of a week, the colony’s scientists are unable to discover anything. Tarian unwilling to wait any longer barges in and demands what they have.<!-- more --> Will the scientists reward his patience with results? Or will the mysteries of this creature elude him?

Tarian threw the doors open and marched into the makeshift lab. He marched towards the cracked table that bore the milky corpse. “What can you tell me about the mystery monster lying on the slab?”

Francis stepped away from his work and glanced around the room at his colleagues. When he saw everyone else glance elsewhere, he cleared his throat. “We’ve found nothing concrete.”

Tarian’s fist clenched as he looked at each of the scientists. When his gaze fell back to Francis, he licked his lips. “You’ve been studying the body for more than a week, and I know Keldon told you I needed answers immediately.”

“He did,” Francis hedged.

“Then why have you been dragging your heels?” Tarian inquired as he took a step towards Francis. While Tarian loomed over the scientist, he prodded the corpse’s abdomen and his finger slid into the creature. With a shudder he pulled it out, stating, “There’s no reason for you all to still be toiling away at this analysis. I should have gotten the results after a day.”

Francis wrung his hands as he tried to look away from Tarian’s glare. “That estimate would have held true if our equipment functioned.” He backed up and licked his lips. “Unfortunately, none of it has worked since we crash-landed.”

Tarian wiped the frustration off his face. “Please tell me there’s an update coming.”
