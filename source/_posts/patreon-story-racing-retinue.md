Today I’m posting, Racing Retinue, the third and final piece of flash fiction for Patreon in August. If you enjoy any of the flash fiction that I post here or on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/StevenMeehan), and you want to get more. You should consider visiting my [Patreon site](https://www.patreon.com/stevenpmeehan). Ever since February, I’ve been posting three unique pieces of flash fiction there. For a $2.00 monthly pledge, you can get access to all seven months of stories. Not to mention all the tales that I will continue to write going forward.<!-- more -->

In addition to the Patreon only stories that I publish, with this tier, you also get to vote for the genres that I write. I post a patron-only poll with seventeen different genres, on the first Monday of the month. As a patron, each month you can vote for any three genres that you want me to write a story for. The following Saturday, I collect the results, and the top three genres form the basis of the upcoming stories.
