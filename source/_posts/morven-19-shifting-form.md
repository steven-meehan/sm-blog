With the live shapeshifter, Caleb captured, the scientists endeavor to perfect the serum they equipped gave Caleb. While they continually tell Tarian they are on the brink of a discovery, the settlement’s leader grows unsatisfied with their progress. He makes almost daily trips to discover their status. On one occasion, Keldon tries to stop him from distracting the scientists.<!-- more --> Will Keldon give the scientists their reprieve from Tarian’s constant interruptions? Or will they provide him the answers he’s looking for?

Keldon grabbed Tarian’s shoulder and spun him around. In the blink of an eye, Tarian closed the distance with his friend and shoved him into the wall. Keldon’s brow furrowed as he took in a deep breath and rammed his finger into Tarian’s chest. “Tarian, you can’t keep bothering the scientists.”

“Caleb secured their shifting monstrosity,” Tarian retorted. He brushed Keldon’s hands off and straightened his jacket. “Didn’t you listen to Caleb? We have to defend ourselves!”

“I know,” Keldon responded, lifting his palms. “But you’re not helping them.”

Tarian took a deep breath and rubbed his temples, “If that monster had approached either you or Engrim, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.” His hands gripped Keldon’s jacket and pulled him closer. “So, if my constant visits help expedite their work, then it’s worth it.”

“But they don’t,” Keldon protested as he shouldered out of his friend’s grasp and faced him. “And that’s exactly what I’m trying to tell you. Your trips blow everything up, and it takes forever to settle down once you leave.”

Tarian’s face scrunched as he stared into the sky as his hand gripped the doorknob. With a twist, he shoved the door open, muttering, “They’ll get over it. Caleb required ten darts to secure his doppelganger.”
