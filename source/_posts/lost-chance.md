With November being slammed with NaNoWriMo, I knew that if I wanted to finish my next Patreon post done, I would have to burn the proverbial midnight oil. One reason I let myself get so wrapped up in the challenge was because of my second genre for November. I needed to craft my first romance. The other was because Survival has been a story that’s floated in my mind for a long time. But now that I won NaNoWriMo, I put the nearly finished project to the side to wade into the field of romance.<!-- more --> 

Wading through a past catalog of NYC Midnight’s Flash Fiction Challenges and selected a prompt. Once I picked the location and object, I let myself wander until a story took shape. With a rough draft in my mind, I started turning the concept into a complete tale. Late last night, or very early this morning, depending on your point of view, I put the finishing touches on my romance that took place in a conference room featuring a sea urchin.
