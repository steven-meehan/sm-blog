Earlier this year, when a trip to Niagara falls first came up, I started wondering when my last real vacation was. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve used vacation days over the years, to break up the daily grind. Granted I’ve just taken a day here, a day there, at least once I’ve taken a week. But those uses of my precious vacation days were always for day trips or some other purpose. I haven’t gone on a trip like this in a long while, a really long while. So, I intend to enjoy every moment of this trip and decompress.<!-- more -->

And if you like it here, you should check out the high-resolution version of the picture. After having sifted through these kinds of scenes, I’m eager to get this trip started.

I am not a city boy. I’m not the guy who can look out of a window and be wowed by a cityscape. But the above image. Now that’s one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. I cannot wait to see it in person.

Starting Monday, August 5th, I’m going to unplug myself from the world.  Aside from any pictures that I post to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/steven.patrick.meehan), and a scheduled [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/stevenpmeehan) post, I’m not going to do anything online until August 11th, when I get home. But that doesn’t mean that I won’t still be writing. I’m merely going low tech. I’ll have a clipboard with me so that I can give [Drawing Thin](https://www.stevenmeehan.com/writing/forgers/drawing-thin). Either that or I’ll let the rampant ideas running around my noggen a chance to escape.

I can’t think of a better way to relax for a week.
