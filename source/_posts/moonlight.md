Often I will come across a show that I have never heard of and I immediately fall in love with, only to find out that it has already been cancelled.  Typically this happens as I’m three or four episodes into the series.  <!-- more --><div class="embedded-image-right">![Moonlight](./moonlight.jpg)</div>I eagerly watch what is available and curse the studio for cancelling a show that I love.  One such show ran on Friday nights on CBS from September 28, 2007 to May 13, 2008.  For a long time I had assumed that the show died due to the Writers Guild of America strike; but, after the strike four new episodes were made, according to the {% link 'show’s Wikipedia pagev' 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_(TV_series)' %}.  It would seem that the powers that be at CBS just decided that Moonlight was not worth the investment.

Now I will agree that, like the series Angel, of which I was a fan, Moonlight also centered on a private detective who, again as in Angel, happens to be a vampire.  Both shows take place in Los Angeles and, yes,  the two lead characters wish to be rid of their “condition”.  However the canons driving the two shows have stark difference; the two biggest differences involve the sun and steaks, neither of which help you kill a vampire in the Moonlight universe. 

Aside from the differences in the canon, the interaction of Josef Kostan and Mick St. John was always fun to watch.  The two were so different in their beliefs it was amazing to me that they were as close as they were.  It also helped that the two actors seemed to play off of each other very well.  Overall I think this was a show that should have been allowed to live and grow, to explore the lives that it created.  This single season series is definitely worth embracing.
