After Dorian got the council to agree with his plan to investigate the missing [colonization ship](/archives/2020/08/19/return). Once the workers laid the last bolt for the new ship and the council finished selecting the crew, the newly commissioned spacecraft launches to the world their ancestors vanished while attempting to colonize. As the vessel settles into an orbit around the planet, the command crew scans the world below. Neither member of the ship’s crew can make sense of the received data, but they transmit the confusing data back home to discuss the fate of the expedition’s mission.<!-- more --> Will the mission to discover the truth about the failed expedition receive its final green light? Or will the scans be enough to answer their questions?

Dyrk adjusted the craft’s trajectory and flipped the communication switch, “Is anyone manning the comm back home?”

“Yes, Dyrk, we’re still here.”

Diana jostled his shoulder as she deactivated the comm. Narrowing her eyebrows, Dianna tapped her armrest and sighed, “Were you expecting them not to be listening?”

Dyrk licked his lips and drummed a console as he winked at Diana, “I figured everyone manning control would be on a break.”

Diana slid forward and covered the microphone, “You’re aware that we’re retracing the colonization vessel’s trajectory. And it vanished the moment it entered this atmosphere, right?”

“I’m aware of the history.” Dyrk peeled Diana’s hand from the comm and tossed it into her lap. He reactivated the system, clearing his throat, “We’ve located the colonization ship.”

“Any signs of survivors?”

Dyrk’s tongue ran across his lips as he scrolled through the results of the scans. “Wendell, I’m uploading you a full copy of the report now. But while you’re waiting, I can describe the eclectic array of life on this rock for you.”
