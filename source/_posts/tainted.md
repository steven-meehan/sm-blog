With [Spinning Portals](/archives/2020/05/20/spinning-portals/) finished, I focused on the next piece. When my patrons included a Fantasy in May, I knew Darren Gilbert would make another Patreon appearance. Over on Wattpad, I’m detailing Darren’s early life with a collection of flash fiction pieces entitled [Journeys](https://www.wattpad.com/story/193730653-darren-gilbert-journeys). But my favorite mage’s creation was right here on Patreon with [Act of Heroism](https://www.patreon.com/posts/25329787). I enjoyed the character so much despite the limited scope of that tale, that I yearned to continue his story and delve into his personal history.<!-- more -->

Even while I’ve explored Darren’s past with Journeys, but I always wanted to do more with the wizard. While it took me a while to connect the dots, I eventually realized that I’d be able to use Patreon for that purpose. And so whenever a Fantasy is selected in the polls, I’m ready to explore additional aspects of this cantankerous mage’s existence. With the character in place, I dove into previous NYC Midnight challenges and pulled one out of the pot and discovered that I needed to drop my cranky mage into a costume shop. Thankfully, my notes of this man’s timeline are well thought out, so I had a straightforward way to drag the grumpy wizard into that situation. Sit back and follow the link to delve into the Story of Darren and Randall as they meander about the store searching for an outfit to wear for a costume party that Randall tricked Darren into attending.

Randall drags Darren to a costume store. And while they search for something for the masquerade, a mysterious woman makes a delivery…

“How did you convince me into agreeing to this foolishness?”

The lithe boy smiled, clapping Darren’s back as he opened the door. Randall’s hand guided Darren into the store, as his grin transformed into a smirk. “We’re here to prepare for the masquerade party tonight.”

“I don’t require dressing up in a foolish outfit to enjoy myself.”

“Darren, despite your constant protests,” Randall stated, lifting an item off the shelf. “You can’t lock yourself away in your home and ignore the rest of the world.” Randall laid the clothing across his chest and donned the mask. “What do you think of this?”

Darren inhaled through his nose as he hung the ware wolf costume back on the rack. “You shouldn’t want to appear that foolish.”

“You used to enjoy these kinds of parties.”

Darren shook his head and walked through the aisle, letting his fingertips trace the outfits. “I’ve turned my attention to other pursuits.” With a huff, Darren spun around and tugged his hair. “How did I let you talk me into this stupid outing?”
