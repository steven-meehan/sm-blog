As I finished [Inquiries](/archives/2020/02/12/inquiries), my attention turned to the next genre for the month of February. I’ve written a few [Fairy Tales](/tags/Fairy-Tale), and each one was fun, though I believe my first, [The Noodle Trap](/archives/2018/10/18/noodle-trap) to be the best of the bunch. But with that said, I started digging into the potential story. While I used a different source of prompts for the first story, I returned to NYC Midnight and picked the prompt placing my story at a family reunion and featuring a fireplace.<!-- more -->

With a full prompt, I started trying to put pieces together. Over the weekend, I wove the first pass together and found the base of a fun Fairy Tale. Come join a little girl and her mother as they discover their family. But the little girl will find things that she never wanted to discover. Click the link below to delve into the story.

A little girl clutches her mother's hand, frightened by the familial strangers. Will all these mysterious individuals be friendly...

Once upon a time, a little girl clutched her mother’s hand as they headed for a campsite. With a sniffle, the little girl pointed at the nearby throng and whined, “I don’t want to go.”

Her mother turned and kneeled in front of her and brushed some locks of hair away from her eyes. She offered the child a wan smile and pulled her into a hug, whispering, “What’s wrong, darling?”

The dutiful daughter buried her face into her mom’s shoulder. “I’m scared something bad will happen if I talk with strangers, and I don’t know anyone.”<div class="center">
