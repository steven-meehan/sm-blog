While I managed to get four of my [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/StevenMeehan) published from October 11th through the 24th, the last one slipped past my self imposed deadline. Despite the complications it made for the week leading up to my wedding interesting, I finished the Patreon [eclusive stories](/tags/Patreon) for October and the latest installment in [Transformation](https://www.wattpad.com/story/195777713-transformation). When last we left off, Isaac won his [Friendly Wager](/archives/2020/08/31/transformation-16) with his co-pilot, Jasmine.<!-- more --> After a few days of collecting his winnings from Jasmine, the two pilots of the Vodan are called into the triumvirs office. Quinn wants to discuss Isaac's flippant behavior and tries to discuss how he'll fix the attitude. Will Quinn deflate Isaac's fury? Or will Isaac's anger at Olyver flow freely?

While Quinn’s fingers tapped his desk, his eyes burned as he studied the slumped pilot across from him. As the triumvir continued tapping a rhythm, his eyes drifted toward the co-pilot, “Jasmine, I paired you with Isaac because I believed you could keep him in line.”

“Is that a workable job for anyone?” She shrugged and shoved Isaac’s legs off Quinn’s desk. “Given his grievances, I’m amazed with my accomplishments.”

“Fair point,” Quinn grumbled. He ran his fingers across his lips and closed his eyes, “Isaac, I appreciate your frustration with Olyver. But please stop provoking him like that.”

“You expect me to give the man who grounded me a free pass?”

Quinn dropped his head and started rubbing his temples. “Not everything is as simplistic as you’d prefer it to be.”

“Is that so?” Isaac pulled his chair towards Quinn and cleared the edge of the desk. He cupped his fingers around his chin as his eyes darkened, “You never say something without giving it a lot of thought. So, please explain yourself.”
