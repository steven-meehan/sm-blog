Between the first entry into this year’s NYC Midnight and my 3D printers, this month’s Patreon flash fiction has been extremely tight. But I’m dedicated to delivering the unique content to my Patrons. So while I drafted this Fantasy early in the month, I had to search for the time needed to finish the Fantasy.

A slight pop echoed as a disembodied voice announced, “In my spare office.”

Darren scowled as his grip tightened around the beverage while his foot tapped against the stone floor. Darren gulped another mouthful as he marched out of the kitchen and bounded up the stairs. He stormed down the hallway and gripped the knob of the room. With a violent shove, the door clanged against the wall, and Darren sauntered into the office. He leaned against the doorframe and waited for Randall to respond.

As the seconds ticked away, Darren’s foot resumed its tapping as he took another pull from his bottle. Darren clicked his tongue and bounced the bottle against his thigh, while Randall stoically hunched over a whizzing and whirling machine.
