My second Patreon exclusive story for October is a crime caper, which means Jessica is coming returning. When I wrote my first one, I dove into a high-end thief, and well, Jessica was born. While I still owe her a last name, and she’ll eventually get one, I’ve grown attached to her. I continually reach out to her to pioneer this genre when it comes up. With a main character in hand, I needed a law for her to break.<!-- more --> And while I can eventually think of something for her to do, I marched to past NYC Midnight’s Flash Fiction Challenges and found a prompt. Circle around and delve into the Caper set in a money counting room and to involve a mirror. 

Jessica's current employer requires her to steal from other criminals. Though she doesn't understand why she needs to hit the count room...
