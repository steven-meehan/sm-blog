I recently came across an article talking about the differences between the various classifications of [stories](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Difference-Between-A-Short-Story-Novelette-Novella-And-A-Novel).  The author briefly talks about those different types of fiction, and for the most part, these would be short stories, novellas, and novels.  And indeed those were the only types I had really ever heard of.  However before the author even mentioned short stories he talked about flash fiction.  The term caught my eye, so I started digging into the term and not just taking this authors definition as gospel.  As a result of that digging, I found out that flash fiction is a story that is roughly less than a thousand words.<!-- more -->

Of course, as I saw that restriction for flash fiction, I thought that no one craft a story in no more than a thousand words, yet I was also intrigued by the idea of it.  With the format in mind, I started looking for some examples of flash fiction.  And as I read a few different examples of the format, I realized that the limit of a thousand words could result in a story just as satisfying as a novel.  Just as long as the words are the right thousand words.

With that realization freshly in mind, I started thinking about what kind of story I could write as flash fiction.  So I started looking through my various notebooks to see if there were any story ideas that I could use for the format.  Unfortunately, all of the stories that I have lined up are scaled up to at least short story length.  And frankly, I don't think I could edit them down to flash fiction size and still maintain a solid storyline.  Just as I was about to dismiss the format from my mind I saw a few entries in one of my notebooks that formed an important part of the backstory for a much larger tale.  More importantly, it was a story arc that I had no intention of telling independently.  So I started to think about how I would take this somewhat lengthy story and fit it into flash fiction sized bites.

However, I was frustrated, so I hopped up and turned on the television and started watching a show.  And as I sat there watching the show, a connection lit up in my mind.  I could tell this story arc as a collection of flash fiction, with each mini-tale telling its own complete story while at the same time laying the bricks for a much larger endeavor, ultimately composing a completed storyline.  The writer inside of me jumped for joy, and I started thinking about how I would disseminate my flash stories, and I decided that I would publish each completed story as a blog post as I wrote them.  Of course, I would tag them so someone could quickly find the complete tale to read or reread them as someone wants.

I am eagerly awaiting my first publication of flash fiction, and I hope that everyone who reads them will find each to be a fantastic story in its own right, as well as enjoying the greater storyline they help to create.
