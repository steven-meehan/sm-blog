Ever since Iron Man came to the big screen in 2008, Marvel Studios has been building to Avengers Infinity Wars and its next installment _Avengers 4_.  This past weekend I left the theater, and I was blown away by the breadth of the film.  Given that I didn't see the movie on opening weekend, I was thankful that I had managed to not hear anything about the movie before I walked into the theater.  That said, I had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, the web is always flooded with various rumors about upcoming movies it especially seems that Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) rumors are particularly rampant.<!-- more --><div class="embedded-image-left">![](./avengers-infinity-war.jpeg)</div>

Now the beautiful thing about the MCU is that since most of the main characters have appeared in at least a single movie of their own.  As a result, the audience has a connection to these characters (some deeper than others) that would just not have been possible without that buildup.  While I want to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, given the scope of these two Avengers movies it should go without saying that each and every main character has at least one impactful moment in the film.  The flip side of that is that people who haven't seen the movies with these characters might not have that connection, to fully appreciate the film.  However, Marvel has done a fantastic job up to this point teasing the audience with Thanos' ultimate plan of [filling out his Infinity Gauntlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RVN1HaZ3CE).

They also have explored the existence of five of the six accompanying Infinity Stones.  With a name of _Infinity War_, the audience knows (or instead should expect) that Earth's mightiest heroes will be fighting to keep Thanos from completing his collection of stones.  I will let the movie answer whether or not the heroes are triumphant as it draws to a conclusion.

The movie starts right where _Thor: Ragnarok_ left off, with the ship carrying the Asgardians floating in space with Thanos' flagship hovering right in front of it.  And from that moment till the credits begin to roll the movie goes from group to group as they begin to react with Thanos' grab for the stones.  Despite being the enemy of the film, Thanos is the character who we learn the most about during the course of the movie.

People who have watched any or all of the movies in the MCU should absolutely watch _Infinity War_ at least once in theaters while it is there.
