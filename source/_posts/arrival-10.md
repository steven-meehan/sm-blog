“What’s going on?” Marcus asked as his fingers traced the door.

Nathaniel lowered his book into his lap and sighed. “Talia is with the doctors, she’ll be fine.”

“She’s been back there longer than the last time,” Marcus countered, wiping his face as he resumed pacing the waiting room. As he walked past Nathaniel, Marcus plucked the book from Nathaniel’s grip and flipped through the pages. “Don’t you have any pressing concerns?”

“Not really,” Nathaniel answered as he rushed to his friend and reclaimed his book. “Thankfully, I have a bustling team of assistants whom I trust.”

Marcus grimaced, taking several deep breaths. “Fine, when’s the estimated completion date for the line to the Western Region?”

“I didn’t think you desired to jump into politics.”

“I don’t,” Marcus grumbled as he dropped into a chair. He rubbed his thighs with shaky fingers. “But until those tracks finish, I can’t complete my work.”

Nathaniel eased across from his friend and wrung his hands. “We’ve already shaved time off your deliveries to Kethra.”
