My final Patreon exclusive story for October came up as a political satire. Sitting down at my desk, I mulled over what I could write about but kept coming up short. After banging my head off the wall, I decided to get some guidance and reached back to the past catalog of NYC Midnight’s Flash Fiction Challenges and found a prompt. With the skeleton of a story in one hand, I still needed to flesh out the rest of the details. Somehow I needed to come up with a satire that took place in a mayor’s office and featured a magnet.<!-- more --> After plenty of soul searching, I plucked a topic out and ran with the rumblings around a potential prohibition.
 
Saul attempts to argue with his elected official to prevent an upcoming ban. But the mayor prefers listening to his next appointment…
