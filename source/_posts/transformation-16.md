Having watched the Vodan, land on its assigned moon of Aurora 3, Isaac and Jasmine return home to report the successful landing. Jasmine wonders about the other two colonization ships that were assigned to the other two viable satellites of the planet. Specifically, she wonders if those pilots would return to Aurora. Isaac remembers that those pilots were planning on settling on their new world and so doubts that they’ll return. Jasmine places a friendly wager that they’ll follow protocol and return before they settle on their new home.<!-- more --> Will Jasmine win their wager? Or will Isaac’s instinct prove to be correct?

Jasmine pressed the button to engage the platform and as it whined to life, she dashed up next to Isaac. “Do you think the other habitable moons orbiting this gas giant have been colonized?”

Isaac shook his head and smirked as he tapped his foot on the dais, “It’s more than likely.” He shrugged and turned his palms up to the ceiling, “I mean the other ships departed at the same time. But if memory serves, those pilots planned on settling on those moons.”

“They’d still need to return to Aurora to report to the triumvirs,” Jasmine said, folding her arms across her chest.

“No,” Isaac reached out and tapped her nose. “They’ll probably head straight to their homes and contact Quinn from there, or they might delegate the task to someone else.”

With a smirk of her own, Jasmine slapped his arm as a flash of white light washed over them. An instant later, she gripped Isaac’s wrist, “Care to place a wager on that?”

“What are you two betting on?” Quinn asked.
