When I finished publishing [Dangling Thread](/archives/2021/05/20/202105-mystery), I turned my attention toward my next piece of flash fiction for May, a Science Fiction tale. As I sat down to type out my initial thoughts, I could hear the captain of the Scythe tugging at me. His pleas to be unleashed for another chance to shine overwhelmed me. So, I thumbed through the last entry in their journey, [Blockade Runner](/archives/2021/02/25/202102-scifi/) , and an initial idea percolated. After delivering Stepan’s cargo, he ordered Daniel and his crew to meet someone on the planetary vessel to secure a precious load of cargo.<!-- more -->

Despite possessing the broad strokes for Daniel Shaw’s pending story, I needed something more. I kept the narrative’s sketch firmly entrenched in my mind and hopped onto a browser. My fingers quickly navigated me to NYC Midnight, and I started searching. I dove into a previous year’s collection and let my search term loop through the science fiction options. As the page cycled through the entries, I felt like a kid on Christmas. When I released the Enter key, I didn’t know how I would fit a canal onto a spaceship. But I was eager to try. Sit down and get comfortable as we follow Daniel’s latest adventure.

Daniel brings Harlan and Rachel with him to a remote section of the massive vessel’s waterway, where they wait for Stepan’s carrier…

Rachel’s cupped fingertips reached into the flowing water, letting it fill her hand. She rose, pulling her fingers out of the river, and let the clear liquid slip through the gaps. Rachel turned around and grinned as she sauntered back to Daniel and Harlan. “You should have brought Franco.”

With a snort, Harlan’s eyelids closed as his head fell. “Can you explain how an engineer would benefit this mission?”

“For a simple exchange, why are you here?” Her fingertips pressed against her chest as her eyes curled into a sultry grin. “For that matter, why was I volunteered for this simplistic trade?”

Daniel shoved his hands into his pockets and pushed himself off the wall. He walked over to her and traced a knuckle against her nose. “The client we’re meeting on behalf of Stepan, is said to have a soft spot for an attractive woman.”

“Well, that’s a valid reason for choosing me to accompany you.” Rachel dragged her wet fingertip along Daniel’s cheek. She playfully slapped his cheek and jerked her chin toward Harlan as the tip of her tongue poked out. “However, can you clarify the wisdom of dragging your weapon’s expert into this meeting?”

“He’s the stick.” Daniel leaned over and stared at the rushing water, “But you didn’t answer Harlan’s question.”
