With each new installment of The Dresden Files I find that I am filled with giddiness due to the rising anticipation of the story.  And as I have consumed each new chapter in this series I have found that I have not been disappointed.  Through each of the fourteen novels I have watched Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden learn and grow, as well as defeat enemies he should have no right walking away from. <!-- more -->

<div class="embedded-image-left">![Welcome to the Jungle](./welcome-jungle.jpg)</div>So I constantly am searching out stories of my favorite professional wizard.  Side Jobs is a nice collection of all the short stories that Butcher has published; it was quickly purchased and read.  But I always seem to be searching for more; so, when I saw {% link 'Welcome to the Jungle' 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Jungle_(graphic_novel)#Welcome_to_the_Jungle_in_other_media' %} , I jumped on the story.  This four part comic book, sorry graphic novel, ran from April to July of 2008, shortly after Small Favor was published. 

{% link 'Despite being released between the aforementioned Small Favor and Turn Coat' 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files' %}, chronologically this mini-series occurs before the events of Storm Front.  For those who are already familiar with the life of Harry Dresden the familiar comforts are all there.  And for those who have yet to be exposed to the life of Chicago’s only professional Wizard this is an excellent beginning to Harry Dresden’s world of investigation.
