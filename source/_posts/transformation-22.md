“Do you have questions concerning this council’s decision?”

Olyver’s fingers tightened around his wrists as he took long breaths through his nose. His fingernails dug into his skin as his eyes flitted between the triad of leaders flanking Caitlin and Quinn. “Would this council consider or dismiss my objections to this farce?”

Caitlin sighed and rested her chin on the gavel, “This assembly will address any of your concerns. However, I don’t think you have any valid reason to object to our decision.”

“I knew it.” Olyver’s eyes scrunched into slits as his fists trembled. “I thought you wanted to keep this process honest.”

Bang!

Caitlin dropped the small hammer and steepled her fingers under her chin, “Contrary to your belief. This council has performed its duty with integrity. Just because you disagree with its determination does not mean it’s void of honor.”
