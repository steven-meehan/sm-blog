Having agreed to find pilots, Darvin rushed from his meeting with Rylan and searched for pilots with the required skills. Unfortunately, skill wasn’t Rylan’s only requirement. After collecting the names of every pilot with the required ability, Darvin started whittling the list down, ensuring those that remained would be loyal to Rylan and Garvin.<!-- more --> Was Darvin able to locate enough pilots for the plan? Or will Liam’s attempts to usurp control be allowed to continue unopposed?

Darvin twisted the statue in his hands as a whistle tore through the thick silence. The large man’s eyes flicked up and latched onto Rylan. Darvin patted the pedestal and grinned. He placed the sculpture down, “I often forget the depths of your collection.”

“It rarely shrinks.”

Darvin winked and walked to another display. “It’s interesting, considering your life on Tergara started as an infamous technician.”

“Our lives have certainly taken a meandering path.” Rylan gripped his friend’s shoulder and pulled him away from the artwork. He guided the broad shouldered Darvin into his office and gestured to a chair. “However, I didn’t call you here to reminisce about the good old days.”

The massive man smirked, pulling a pair of pads from under his jacket. Darvin slid them across the desk and tapped them with a meaty finger. “The first contains redacted resumes for the best pilots available. Every one of them can undertake this mission, collect all the information you’re seeking, and is completely trustworthy.”

Waving the device, Rylan leaned close. “You’re not going to share their names?”
