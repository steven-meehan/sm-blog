Kethra, who has overcome a vote of no confidence in the Eastern Region, is pressing for Nathaniel to be held accountable for the detonation of the power cells. While the other leaders will listen to Nathaniel’s explanation, they refuse to allow the meeting to proceed while they are missing a leader.<!-- more --> The representative of the Northern Region insists that Marcus be brought so they can proceed.

“It’s okay Marcus, you don’t need to spare my feelings. It was an utter disaster.” Nathaniel slapped his thighs and ground his teeth. “One Kethra’s using to usurp control.”
