I remember almost five years ago I bought a computer game called [Torchlight](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085P7YGU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mysite009e-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0085P7YGU&linkId=235131b07ffde76feb3b808a08e7fd4e) from Amazon.  A friend had recommended the game, and I decided it was time to give it a try, so I started a game.  There are three classes for that game, the Vanquisher, the Destroyer and The Alchemist.  I remember hearing that the Alchemist was akin to a mad scientist, at least in the broadest of definitions.  So I leapt at the chance to play the Alchemist, and I gave him the name Harrison.

One of the interesting aspects of the game is that your character gets an animal companion right from the start.  I chose the feline companion, and I came up with the name of Sylvia, I may have used the random name generator though at this point I honestly can’t remember how I chose the name of that companion. <!-- more -->  As I was playing that very first game, my mind began to seed the beginnings of a story.  Looking back at that memory, I want to say that those initial thoughts bore early fruit.  I had the idea of a partnership between a mad scientist and inventor and a woman who could assume any feline form she wanted.

It took time for me to craft that initial thought into a proper storyline, but I eventually managed to form a storyline I was happy to call my own.  Though once I had that, I needed to decide how I would tell the tale of Harrison & Sylvia.  With the storyline building in my mind, I began to think about how I would bring their tale to life.  I bounced a few different ideas around in my mind, but I ultimately decided that a collection of short stories would be a fantastic way to explore this story.  So I took that initial storyline that was floating in my mind, and I began to craft my collection of short stories.

Off and on over the last five years, I have been working on these stories.  Granted the work on Harrison & Sylvia was mostly off but now close to five years after the initial concept I’m close to being finished with them.  The stories are currently getting a once-over from a few people so I can have the best stories that I can possibly have.  Once they have been reviewed, I’ll be folding in those suggestions into the final work.  Then they will be ready for publication, and I already know how I want to publish them.  In fact, the reason I chose to use short stories was due to how I wanted to bring them to the world.  I'm planning on releasing them on my site over the course of a year, one story every month.

As I publish one of these short stories, I will post a News article linking to it.  The accompanying article will include the story's image and a brief blurb letting people know what to expect.  I’m striving to keep to my deadline, which is continually getting tighter, but assuming I’m able to the first installment of [Harrison & Sylvia](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01) should be ready for posting this coming January.  So stay tuned for the adventures that will unfold throughout 2019.
