With my first Patreon tale completed, I turned my attention to working on my second story, a Historical Fiction. I’ve gotten this genre a few times and they are always fun. They require a lot of work, but they’re enjoyable to craft. The last one I wrote in this genre was [**Letters**](/archives/2019/10/01/letters/) for the NYC Midnight competition. Just like with Letters, I dug into the history of the period to graft clues to ground the piece in its place in history.<!-- more -->

I reached back into NYC Midnight’s catalog and plucked a Historical Fiction prompt. With the setting, a fire station, and an object, a mosquito net, to work into the tale, I started working on the bones of the story. After some thought, an idea took root. As the yarn unfolded in my mind, I pictured two firemen huddling around a particular locker. As I pushed down this path, the concept became fully entrenched until I had the initial draft. Head over to my Patreon page to read this narrative between the station’s chief and one of his men.

After extinguishing a fire, the Chief returns to his station and insists on handling a grim duty alone…
