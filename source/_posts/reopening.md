With April coming to a close, I turned my attention toward the last piece of flash fiction for my patrons, a Political Satire. As I thumbed through headline after headline, I kept coming back to COVID-19. So, just like [last month](/archives/2020/03/25/lockdown), I tackled a story concerning the virus, though this time, the headlines about states reopening were the inspiration. But I needed a seed so the tale could flourish. When I found that kernel, the story flowed through my fingers on the page.<!-- more -->

Come around, and I’ll tell you the story of a pair of friends, one thrilled to emerge from the confines of her home while and the other terrified that she will catch the disease. Stacy, the fearless one, convinces Lucile to visit a wax museum that poorly picked its opening.

When their governor lifts the lockdown, Stacey drags Lucile to a newly opened museum. Will they be fine, or will they catch the bug…

Lucile lifted her mask over her nose and climbed out of her car. As her door slammed shut, she stared at the unassuming building looming in front of her. Her fingers adjusted the cloth covering her face as she marched toward the structure. When Lucile finished climbing the stairs, she caught sight of her friend, lounging on the bench just to the right of the entrance. “Stacey, why are we going to a wax museum?”

“To see the exhibits,” Stacy replied as she shifted her mask. The fabric stretched as she leaned forward. “That’s the reason people visit galleries?”

With a fierce sigh, Lucile slammed her hands against her thighs. “We’re in the middle of a quarantine! Why isn’t this place closed?”

“We aren’t dealing with a lockdown anymore.” Stacey quipped as she spun around and scampered through the wooden doors. “With the governor lifting the stay at home order and all. Besides, the museum is finally open, and we planned on coming before life was turned upside down.”

“Just because our dopey officials have lifted that restriction, doesn’t mean that we should be here.” Lucile stared at the parking lot and added. “This world-wide pandemic has gone nowhere.”
