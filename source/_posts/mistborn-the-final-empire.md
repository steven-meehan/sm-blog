I remember a few years ago, well maybe closer to five years ago, I was walking through a local Barns & Noble and out of the corner of my eye I saw a hardcover book which cover caught my eye.  I immediately picked it up, gave it a once over and was gripped by the reviews.  I am fairly sure the book was not The Final Empire, it was The Hero of Ages, if my memory serves me correctly.  <!-- more --><div class="embedded-image-left">![Mistborn](./mistborn.jpg)</div>I remember instantly wanting to read this novel, but I was unwilling to start with the last book of a trilogy.

Armed with the trilogy’s name and author I took my trusty first generation Kindle and purchased {% link 'The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson' 'http://www.amazon.com/Mistborn-The-Final-Empire-ebook/dp/B002GYI9C4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0' %}.  From the very first page I was hooked by Sanderson’s world.  He took nothing for granted, borrowing nothing from any other previous fantasy author, at least none that I have ever heard of.  He could have gone down the easy path and used a tried and true magic system.  But no, he invented a unique system that held no magic.  The abilities gifted from {% link 'Allomancy' 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allomancer' %}, {% link 'Feruchemy' 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feruchemist#Feruchemy' %} and {% link 'Hemalurgy' 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn_series#Hemalurgy' %} are a blast to explore through the course of the series, not to mention on Wikipedia. 

The characters are as well written as the magic system is.  The unique strengths of each character compliment not only the story, but the other characters as well.  Everyone should take the time to read this trilogy and enjoy Sanderson’s tapestry of words.
