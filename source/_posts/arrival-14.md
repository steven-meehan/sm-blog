Nathaniel shoved Marcus’s front door open and stormed inside. His fiery eyes latched upon the first person in sight, and Nathaniel grabbed the farmhand’s collar, pulling the worker’s face next to his. “Where is Marcus?”

The man whimpered as he tried peeling Nathaniel’s hand off his shirt.

“Nathaniel, stop intimidating my workers.” Marcus pushed the door open and sauntered in, carrying his baby girl. He crossed the room and squeezed his friend’s shoulder. “Marty, head to the fields and start feeding the livestock.” He released his friend and stepped aside. “I’ll be there once we’ve finished.”

Marty’s focus remained on Nathaniel as he crept towards the exit. When he backed into the wall, he blindly fumbled for the doorknob. The moment his fingers located the latch, he swallowed and opened the door, “On it, boss.”

After Marty vanished, Marcus pointed to the doorway he came through. “Will this revolve around the other day?”

“Amongst other things.” Nathaniel stalked through the opening and scurried to the set of chairs. As he eased into the nearest seat, the lines covering his face melted away.
