As Fortunes comes to a close, I have to stop and examine the journey this tale has taken from a seed to the fully fleshed out story of Rylan the technician. Looking back at the entire series, I’m amazed at how the tale changed from the initial ideas. The story grew and took on a life of its own. As the tale twisted away from the path I originally envisioned, a careful nudge and edit kept it in place while allowing the narrative to grow and develop.<!-- more -->

With this last entry in Fortunes, my mind began toying with the next storyline to explore the technician’s world. And I needed a way to both complete this storyline and prepare the next one. Hopefully, I’ve accomplished this balancing act. Join me as I put a pin in this long-running series about loss and discovery.

Rylan parted the curtains and stared out the window. “You could have told me just how powerful your family is.”

“True, but it wouldn’t have been fun otherwise,” Annabelle answered as she crossed the room and leaned against the wall. She jabbed his stomach with her elbow and grinned. “Though I doubt you would have listened to me since you never shared that kind of information.”

With a grunt, Rylan let the curtain fall. “You know I did what the situation required of me.”

Annabelle flung the curtains apart and slid the door open. She took a deep breath of the air and beckoned Rylan to join her on the terrace. Without waiting to see if he obeyed, she strode out and leaned against the railing.

“Do you honestly think your family can shelter us?”

Annabelle smirked as her elbow flew into Rylan’s side. “With the crystals you liberated from the storage assembly, Daddy’s already one-upped the Captain’s incomplete hard copy of the incident.”

“That’s not surprising considering it wasn’t a complete report.” Rylan rested against the rail. “I assume the other crystals will solidify our efforts.”
