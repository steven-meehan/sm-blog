Despite not my dislike of writing comedies, finding a comedy selected in the monthly pool wasn’t the reason my writing spiraled out of control this past month. But when I carved out the time that I needed to write my stories, I poured everything into the tales and started crafting my comedy. I’ve looked into writing comedies in the past and discovered a couple pointers that I wove into the fabric of my narrative. But before I could leverage those techniques, I searched for a prompt.<!-- more -->

I found this one from NYC Midnight’s past catalogue. Though I didn’t like the Comedy ones, so I searched the page for one that spoke to me. It didn’t take me long to liberate the location and object from another one to serve as the backbone for this attempt at comedy. With the location firmly entrenched in my mind, my memory screamed at me to leverage some of the comedy skits I’ve seen on Whose Line is it Anyway. Sit down and follow Elizabeth and Gregory as they volunteer for a fundraiser.

Elizabeth is a wonderful person who seeks to help everyone join her as she drags her boyfriend to her latest fundraiser…

“Elizabeth, I know you enjoy dedicating your spare time to helping people.” He wriggled his hands under his chin, “But why are we heading to this fundraiser?”

“Bah,” Elizabeth spun around as her lips curled into a deep smile. Her head fell to her shoulder while she walked backwards towards their destination. “Gregory, why is the idea of helping the needy such a problem for you?”

Gregory grabbed her shoulders and pulled her towards him, “Why do you jump to this argument?”

With a smirk, Elizabeth shrugged out of his grasp and waggled her finger.

Gregory sucked on his lips as he took a deep breath. “No, there’s nothing wrong with helping people,” Gregory muttered as he dragged his fingers down his face. With a grunt, Gregory thrust his hands into his pockets as he kicked some debris into the street.

“Then why are you arguing about this?” Her hands slammed together under her devilish grin. Elizabeth twirled around and hurried down the sidewalk. “Now stop lollygagging! There are people who need our help.”
