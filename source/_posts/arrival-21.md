“Marcus is busy,” Vincent’s voice sliced through the wall. “You’ll have to come back later.”

“You’ve been saying that for more than a week,” a shrill reply chased Vincent’s words. “We are tired of waiting for him to disseminate his plans for our people.”

Marcus slipped his pad onto the desk and tucked the pen behind his ear. He rested his chin upon his thumbs and watched the door creep inward. Vincent’s head poked through the opening while he licked his lips. “Boss, there are a handful of complainers here, and they’re demanding you take some time out of your day to speak with them concerning their future.”

Marcus laid his hands on the desk and pursed his lips. He glared at the door and blew out a long breath as he slumped into his seat. Marcus stared at the ceiling, clicked his tongue and bit his lower lip, “I suppose I should deal with Kethra’s lingering lieutenants.”

With a nod, Vincent vanished as he pulled the door. However, before it could latch, something flung it open, letting a trio march into the office.

Marcus’s eyes widened as he examined the three strangers. He raised his hands and forced his mouth to curl upward, “Hello, Roxanne, how are you doing?”
