After Darvin left, Rylan sent a message to his father-in-law to start the production of the vessles.

After Darvin left, Rylan sent a message to his father-in-law to start the production of the vessels. Garvin pushed back on some of the leaner aspects of Rylan’s initial designs, but eventually the two came to an agreement. Promptly after that, Garvin arranged for the construction of the three vessels. With the production of the ships started, Rylan’s focus shifts to acquiring all the various bits of gear Darvin insisted his pilots would need for their flights. With the ships constructed and the equipment purchased, will Darvin be satisfied? Or will he insist Rylan and Garvin provide more for the selected pilots?

Darvin’s fingers traced the outer hull of the vessel as he roamed around the spaceship. When he made a full circuit of the craft, he knocked his knuckles against the fuselage. Darvin wrung his hands and scurried across the warehouse to Rylan. “You weren’t kidding about the size of these ships.”

Rylan rubbed his jaw while his foot tapped the warehouse’s floor. “If I recall correctly, single seaters were all that I promised for your pilots.” Rylan ran his fingers through his hair and grinned. He gripped his quivering leg, stopping its motion. “I trust they’re able to pilot those.”

“Capable?” Darvin’s massive shoulders climbed while his lips contorted. “Yes, but they won’t enjoy the flight.”

“Unfortunately, their ability is the only pertinent factor.”

With a shake of his head, Darvin lifted the pack and withdrew a tablet. He slipped the bag’s strap over his shoulder and activated the device. He flipped through the documents and opened the schematics for the vessel. As his gaze climbed up, he tapped the tip of his nose. “Are all the coffins the same model?”

With a snort, Rylan strode to Darvin and lifted the pad. “Everything you need is detailed in these files, but yes, all three ships are identical.”
