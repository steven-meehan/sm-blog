When all four leaders arrive at the capital building's burnt-out remains, Nathaniel proposes an alternative plan for survival.<!-- more --> Will the gathered leaders agree with Nathaniel's proposal?

Nathaniel drummed his fingers against the table’s edge as his scowl deepened. With quivering lips, Nathaniel thrust a finger towards Kethra, “Would you stop dragging this meeting out and vote already?”

All eyes whipped toward the source, finding Marcus leaning against the table.
