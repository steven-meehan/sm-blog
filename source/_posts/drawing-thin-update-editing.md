Journeys are all about the experience. No matter where you are going or what you are doing the trip will always be a part of the experience. When I published [Dead Man's Hand](https://www.stevenmeehan.com/writing/forgers/dead-mans-hand/), I remember being on cloud nine at every major milestone. <!-- more -->It was an incredible experience that I encourage anyone who has ever thought about crafting a book to do. But I as I make my way through the publication of my second novel, Drawing Thin. I find that I'm still reaching those same highs.<div class="embedded-image-left">[![Drawing Thin](/writing/forgers/drawing-thin/drawing-thin.jpg "Drawing Thin")](/writing/forgers/drawing-thin)</div>

But as with every repeated journey, no two trips are the same. For this book, I found a new editor through [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/), and I will always be thankful that I found him. I used his services with my Harrison & Sylvia series that I am currently publishing and found his insights fantastic. So I arranged to have him work on the novel, and I have already gotten it back. As with his work on my short stories, his feedback has been as constructive as it is terrific.

I have not begun the process of incorporating those insights just yet. I'm still in the middle of a couple of other projects. But once I wrap those up, I will start working through the edited manuscript. Presently I am planning on starting early in May. And while I plan on taking all the time I need to craft the best book I can, I'm confident that I'll be able to publish it on August 31st this year.
