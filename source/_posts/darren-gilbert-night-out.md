Roland glanced at the bottom of his glass and groaned. “Is anyone else running on empty?”

Maxwell drained his mug and grinned. Twirling it in his hands, he replied, “Well, it would seem that you’ve broken the rule about asking about dry cups. It looks like you’re buying us some food.”

“Ugh…” Roland grunted as he emptied the remnants of his drink. He slammed the glass down and waved down their waitress.

With a smile, Darren finished his and placed the cup next to the other two. “Perfect timing for an appetizer.”

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Rolland muttered as the waitress approached the table.

With a wink at Roland, Rianna leaned against the booth. “What can I do for three of my favorite customers?”

Roland rolled his eyes and waved at the empty glasses. “Rianna, we need some refills, as quickly as possible.”

“Certainly,” Rianna replied. “I’ll be right back.”
