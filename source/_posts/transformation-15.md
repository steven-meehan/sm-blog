With the inertial world already folded into the fledgling federation, Isaac and Jasmine are piloting the newly redesigned world ship to the next colony. Though Isaac is dissatisfied with the level of automation, the engineers stuffed into the newest vessel. The updated systems have relegated the pilot to a glorified chaperon.<!-- more --> Will Isaac get his wish for an interesting landing? Or will Jasmine get her wish for an uneventful landing?

Isaac swiveled in his chair, tossing a ball over his head. When the sphere reached the top of its arc, he grabbed it and slammed it against his console, “I’m bored.”

“Isaac, focus on successfully landing this world ship.”

The pilot sat up, turning away from his copilot and hefted it as his eyes narrowed. Isaac licked his lips while he glanced over his shoulder and chucked it at the woman sitting behind 
him. “Heads up, Jasmine.”

She batted the incoming missile. “Can’t you be serious? Where did these balls come from?”

Isaac’s head turned, and he winked at Jasmine. “I’m capable of taking things seriously. However, given this ship’s level of automation, there’s nothing for me to do.”

“Does that include landing?” Jasmine asked as her fingers made quotes in the air. “Or have you forgotten about the last colony ship you piloted?”
