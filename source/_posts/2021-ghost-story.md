With the completion of [*Fundraising*](/archives/2021/04/26/2021-comedy/) and [*Private Friend*](/archives/2021/04/28/2021-fairy-tale/), I focused every creative muscle towards the completion of my last story for April. While I haven’t written a lot of ghost stories before, my favorite one is [*Journey of Thanks*](/archives/2018/11/13/journey-of-thanks/). It was the second one I wrote, and I lucked into an amazing concept. The story’s protagonist is a ghost, doomed to haunt a city unable to interact with anyone. The only direction given to our protagonist is a note fused to his palm.<!-- more -->

I enjoyed the broad strokes of that tale so much that I reused them with another tale, [Message](/archives/2020/09/30/message/). So when I settled in to write my latest ghost story, I pulled on the same threads to craft the story. Which means there is another ghost who is wandering throughout a city with a note and a booming voice trying to get him to an address. Unfortunately, Gregor is a little stubborn, so the voice has to press the issue. Sit down and watch as Gregor learns about the impact his life had on others.

Death is nothing like what Gregor thought it would be. He is alone and unable to interact with anyone. Gregor’s only guide is a note…

The shade wafted above the quiet streets of the city, while running his fingers through his thinning hair. As he approached the sidewalk, the spirit descended to the pavement and spun around, chewing his lower lip. “I figured that part of being dead, was the ability to haunt anyone you didn’t like.” His gaze drifted up while his lips stiffened, “There’s always traffic on the roads! But since I’ve woken up, I haven’t seen a single soul to scare.”

“Gregor, follow your instructions!”

The ghost’s hands flew to protect his ears while his knees buckled to the ground. When the reverberations from the booming voice vanished, Gregor’s eyes darted across the sky. His body rose from the cement and he brushed off his ghostly shoulder. “Yeah, you keep saying that.” Gregor lifted his left palm and tapped the note attached to it. “Unfortunately, the only piece of information you gave was an address. We’ve had this discussion, and without significantly more than that, I’ll pass.”

“You will discover the answers you seek, if you follow the guide.”

The shade interlaced his hands behind his head and laid back, drifting above the sidewalk. He looked to each side, released a long breath, and crossed his ankles. “And I’ve told you, unless I know what I’ll find there, I’m more comfortable relaxing somewhere else.” With a smile worming its way across his lips, Gregor closed his eyes. “Your choices couldn’t be simpler. If I need to undertake this journey, then tell me what I am supposed to discover. Otherwise, I’m going to relax right here.”

Bright yellow lights sparked to life amidst the clouds and began dancing amongst them. “Get up and gather your answers.”
