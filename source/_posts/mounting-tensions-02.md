On the day of the vote, Rylan arrives to find Liam arguing his position on several unrelated topics.<!-- more -->  Will Liam’s latest arguments sway the council? Or can Rylan’s previous efforts overcome Liam’s propaganda?

Rylan eased into the seat beside Garvin and folded his hands in his lap. After listening to the drivel for a few minutes, he leaned toward his father-in-law and tapped his shoulder. “Why’s the council allowing Liam to drone on like this?”

“He’s been droning on,” Garvin took a breath and glanced at his watch. “He’s been hammering multiple points for a few hours.” The older man rubbed his mouth with both hands and huffed, “Though those of us who’ve been here from the beginning would swear it’s been days.”

Rylan’s head fell into his headrest as he closed his eyes, listening to the propaganda spewing from Liam’s mouth. When Liam repeated his objections for the tenth time, Rylan tugged Garvin’s shirt. “Haven’t we listened to enough of Liam’s nonsense?” Rylan released his hold and thumped his forehead. “Annabelle and I torpedoed his desire to rely on ships, why haven’t we overhauled the platforms?”

“Because our friendly captain is persistent.”

“How is that affecting the vote to overhaul the platforms?”

“Well, as your presentation implied, he’s clutching at straws, and while you torpedoed his strongest argument with the rebuttal you and Annabelle crafted, he switched to other convincing arguments.” With a huff, Garvin pulled a pad from his jacket and brandished it in front of Rylan. “Unfortunately, you shouldn’t miss council meetings. Digging through their propaganda gives us a chance to understand his agenda.”
