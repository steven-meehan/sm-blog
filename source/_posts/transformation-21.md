“I can read your profile from now until the day I die, Annabelle.” Caitlin lowered the pad into her lap as she huffed. She bounced the tablet against her desk and thumped it onto the table. “Unfortunately, this doesn’t tell me anything about who you are.”

“What would you like to know?”

Caitlin’s fingers locked together, forming a temporary bed for her head. Her eyes flicked to the entrance and lingered on the individual standing in the doorway. She raised her hand and signaled the man to wait. And in a fluid motion, she propped her chin against her knuckles. “Anabelle, why are you following in my footsteps? Politics is a tiring endeavor. Wouldn’t you be happier doing something far simpler with your life?”

“Excuse me?” Annabelle ran a fingertip across her lips. “Why are you worried about my motives?”

“A person’s motivations tell the most about a person and their choices.” Caitlin pulled her hands away from her face and smiled. “And I’m curious about what drove you here?”

“Excuse me, Caitlin, but I can’t believe your replacement in the Auroran triumvirate is the most pressing issue on your agenda.”
