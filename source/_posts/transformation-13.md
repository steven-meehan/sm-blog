Fresh off a meeting with his constituents, Olyver works with Caitlin on a way to ramp up the colonization efforts. After multiple edits, the two produce a draft of the orders that will catapult them to the rest of the system. Now they need to get Quinn’s consent, but he’s steadfast in his belief that they have to expand at a snail’s pace.<!-- more --> Will Caitlin and Olyver be able to sway Quinn? Or will he sandbag their efforts to finish colonizing the Auroran system?

Quinn tapped his desk and looked over the proposal. When he finished going over the document, he dropped the pad and groaned. He glared at Olyver and took a lengthy breath. “Caitlin, is there any reason you’ve abandoned the plan we originally detailed?”

Caitlin nodded as she picked up the device. “We have four additional colonies to establish in this system.”

“And we don’t have the resources to do that all at once,” Quinn rebuked, slamming his hand down to punctuate his words.

Olyver’s lips curled into a mocking grin. He folded his hands behind his back and tilted his head. “The supporting documentation about the population are included in the pad. Didn’t you read through those sections?”

With a growl, Quinn lifted the device. “Yes, Olyver, I scrutinized the entire report.” He tossed it at the triumvir and continued. “But as usual you’re shortsighted. If we press on with our colonization efforts before each colony establishes itself all the colonies will fail, including Aurora.”

“That’s not entirely true,” Caitlin replied. She sauntered next to Quinn and kneeled, taking his hand in hers. She withdrew another pad and placed it into his. “Don’t forget that Aurora was a world ship.”
