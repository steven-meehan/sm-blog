I hope everyone has a Happy Thanksgiving! November is a magical month. Besides challenging writers to do something [incredible](https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano), it’s a time to focus on family and our good fortunes. And while hosting Thanksgiving dinner is hectic, it allows me to blend a day of family with my love of cooking. Aside from continuing my NaNoWriMo project, preparing Thanksgiving dinner, writing my Patreon exclusives ([*Hearth*](/archives/2020/11/13/hearth), [*Strands*](/archives/2020/11/18/strands), and my upcoming Historical Fiction), I’ve kept my focus and finishing my Wattpad stories. With this story, I’m returning to Darren Gilbert’s youth and his [Journeys](https://www.wattpad.com/story/193730653-darren-gilbert-journeys).<!-- more -->

In the last installment of Darren’s Journey, we saw our young wizard in training playing a game with his classmates Maxwell and Norry. While the three friends played, the arrogant and annoying Wayne barged into their game and stirred the pot. Come delve into the aftermath of Wayne’s bombastic interruption.

As Darren climbed the stairs, he stretched his neck and rubbed his biceps. When he got to his floor, Darren sauntered to his door, pulling it open. He tossed his bag beside the bunk and collapsed face-first into the mattress while pulling a sheet over his head. “How was your day, Maxwell?”

A hand jostled Darren, saying, “We need to talk.”

With a groan, Darren flipped over and pushed himself up against the wall. He took in the packed bags on Maxwell’s bunk and bolted upright. He scooted to the edge of his bed and leaned over his knees, wringing his hands. “What’s going on?”

Maxwell grunted and sat down, patting the packs lying on the mattress. “I’m heading out.”

“You haven’t been expelled from the Academy, have you?”

An eyebrow climbed Maxwell’s face as he shook his head. “Life isn’t as dramatic as you make it out.”
