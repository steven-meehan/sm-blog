Darren rubs his splinted arm as he pulls his assignment from his bag. He remembers the duel that caused the injury, and he groans at the sudden pain that lances up his forearm. When the stack of papers appear on the right side of his head, Darren collects them and adds his sheet to the pile. He hands them to the student in front of him and wonders if Imryll could assist him in improving his defenses.<!-- more --> Will Imryll give him extra help with defensive magic? Or will she turn him away and let him flounder with defensive magic?

Imryll sat down and reached for the pile of papers. She claimed the first sheet and scanned the document. With a sigh, she dropped the paper and stared at her students. “Well, I think that’s enough for today, go enjoy yourselves before your next class.”

While the pupils began packing up, the teacher yanked the initial page from the stack and a red pen and started marking it.

After Darren slipped his papers into the folder, he itched at his splinted arm. He shut his eyes, biting his lower lip and took a few deep breaths. Darren twisted and tapped Maxwell’s shoulder. “Max, you and the rest of the guys should head out without me.”

Maxwell stared at their instructor and leaned over. “This was our last class of the day, we’re hitting the town tonight.”

“Sorry, but I have to bail on you,” Darren replied as he closed his bag and shoved it under his desk. Darren lifted his uninjured hand and jerked his thumb towards their teacher. Lifting his injured arm, Darren continued, “I think some extra one-on-one training with Imryll, might prove beneficial for me.”

The Dwarf’s face scrunched as he slung his pack onto his back. “You want additional work for biology?”

With a grin, Darren patted Maxwell. “You got to do everything in your ability to excel at the subjects you’re weak on.”
