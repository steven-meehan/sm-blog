Rylan hobbled out of the hospital, clutching the edges of his coat in a fist. He scrutinized the nearby vehicles as a shudder thundered down his spine, “Are we walking home?”

“It isn’t far,” Annabelle pulled Rylan’s arm around her shoulders and guided him down the street. After a few steps, she released his wrist and pointed down the road. “Can you see the dark green one? It’s only three cars down.”
