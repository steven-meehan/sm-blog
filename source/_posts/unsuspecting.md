During my day job, one of my coworkers commented that during this quarantine to help stem the spread of COVID-19, that I would be fine. Well, as the days unfolded, I’ve realized just how accurate he was. Aside from spending time with my family, I threw myself into my writing. As I started collecting and organizing all my scattered stories for my Wattpad series, I recognized that the Action/Adventure story could be placed into one of those worlds, giving my patrons a little extra insight into the world that [Transformation](https://www.wattpad.com/story/195777713-transformation) is exploring. With the setting determined, I turned to NYC Midnight and plucked a prompt from the list.<!-- more -->

With the bare bones of a locale and the prompt firmly entrenched in my mind, I began delving into how to make the narrative work. [Transformation](https://www.wattpad.com/story/195777713-transformation) is a sci-fi series, so I thought about how I could create a futuristic subway station, until I remembered the beginning of the tale. This civilization has the technology to traverse solar systems via platforms, so I made a slight adaption to their technology to make them smaller to replace traditional subways with these daises. Sit down and get comfortable as we delve into the story.

As a couple walks off the waystation and a set of thugs brandishing weapons encircled them. Will the couple be the latest victims…

The couple stepped off the small dais and basked in the illumination emanating from the strips running along the walls. The man extended his arm, and the woman latched onto it as they walked away from the waystation. As a grin emerged, he reached out and traced her chin. “What’s our schedule for this evening?”

She bit her lower lip as her eyes flitted from his face to the surroundings. “What is available in this part of the capitol?”

“A plethora of options,” he replied, shrugging his shoulder. “There are theaters throughout this district, not to mention plenty of fine restaurants.” His grin broadened as he tugged her closer and licked his lips. “Though, the platform could whisk us to the coast.” With a wink, he kissed her forehead, adding, “There we could take a stroll along the beach basking in the sunset and the cresting waves.”

Her eyes widened at the suggestion and drifted toward the dais. “Jarrett, that last one sounds like a wonderful way to spend the evening.”

As the two approached the platform, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkest recesses, brandishing a small knife. “I’m sorry to interrupt such amorous plans. But as the locally appointed tax collector, I must collect the funds to use this waystation.” The thug stepped toward the pair and pressed the blade’s edge against Jarrett’s shoulder. “Shall I examine you for the required payment?”

“Is this fool serious?”
