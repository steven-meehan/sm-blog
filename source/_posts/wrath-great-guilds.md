After reading the rest of the Pillars of Creation series, I picked up the [last installment](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625671415/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1625671415&linkCode=as2&tag=mysite009e-20&linkId=83d6bf4e22860dbf7561553a0f385e31) with great eagerness.  From Mage Alain's vision in the first book to the Master Mechanic Marie's dread of her ultimate destination throughout the series to the end of the _Servants of the Storm_, I had a rough idea of what the story was going to be.  As I read each page my hope that I would get a satisfying conclusion to the series grew and grew, and while the series was ended with a satisfactory completion, it did create another new thread that would be continued in another series, _The Legacy Of Dragons_.<!-- more --><div class="embedded-image-right">![](./wrath-great-guilds.jpg)</div>

The story begins with Marie and Alain on their way to Doorcastle to aid the city in its defense from the great guilds and the empire.  Their journey was not without its dangers, but they are able to successfully lead their small collection of soldiers to the city dealing with all of the issues that come up displaying their determination and empathy for the people caught in the crosshairs of the antagonistic guilds.

Throughout the story, both Master Mechanic Marie's and Mage Alain's character are tested, and both stay true to their core.  Neither wavier in their convictions or their ultimate desires.  In fact, as Mage Alain continues his journey for the wisdom he manages to do something that no other mage had ever been able to do.

After having read _The Pillars of Creation_, I enjoyed the story that the series told; but I would have appreciated it if the author had written the books as complete stories in their own right.  Instead, he wrote them as episodic stories, almost like episodes of a television show.  Again the story is a good one that I enjoyed, and it is worth being read by anyone.  However, I think it could have been better if the books had been written to stand entirely on their own.
