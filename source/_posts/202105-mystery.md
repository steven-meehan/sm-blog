When I pulled the results of the genre poll, my stomach fluttered when I saw a Mystery in the mix for the month. I don’t normally write in this genre, but I’m happy about the opportunity to stretch my abilities. Each time I craft a narrative using an uncomfortable genre, I emerge from the journey a little more formed. So, I dropped behind my computer and started poking at my keyboard. <!-- more -->Unfortunately, the only fruit that initial session bore was to use my Private Investigator, Kyle Rickman.

After staring at the empty screen, I opened my Chrome browser and visited a page of past NYC Midnight prompts. A few seconds into the search I landed on an interesting one, though its location and object weren’t assigned to a Mystery. But it didn’t matter. The combination sparked my mind. May’s instalment of Insight Investigations will take place in a planetarium and feature a ribbon. And just like that, the storyline flourished, as the outline couldn’t flow from my fingers fast enough. Sit down and follow Kyle as he searches for a murderer.

Kyle Rickman’s latest investigation drags him to a local planetarium. Despite previous searches, Kyle is certain he’ll uncover the truth…

Kyle leaned against the doorframe and withdrew a worn leather-bound notebook from his coat pocket. He ran his fingertips along the supple cover and pulled the small pen from its slot. Kyle eased the book open and thumbed through the pages until he located the section devoted to this client’s case. The pencil’s tip bounced against the sheet as he reviewed the details.

When he finished, Kyle laid the pencil against the interior binding and closed the book around his index finger. Folding his arms across his chest, Kyle walked into the domed chamber. While Kyle’s eyes flittered about the room, he meandered through the seats. Halfway through one row, Kyle stopped and bent down to explore the area under the chair. He spotted a scrap of paper and pressed the eraser against it to drag it out.

Kyle’s fingers traced his chin as he perused the tattered document. He released the sheet and withdrew his phone. Kyle unlocked the device and called the first number programed in it. When the ringing stopped, Kyle cleared his throat. “Dwayne, can you pull up some documentation on Clarissa’s case?”

“If you graduated from that paper notebook of yours to a nifty tablet you wouldn’t have to make so many of these calls.”

Kyle grinned as he climbed into an open seat. His head dropped to the back of the chair, making several clicks with his tongue. “You’re technically correct, but there’s a slight consequence with that alteration.”

“Yeah, what’s that?”
