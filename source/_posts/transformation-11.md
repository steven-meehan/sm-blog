As flames raced up the prow of the ship, Isaac sank into his chair and groaned.

“What’s wrong with you?” Jasmine asked.

Isaac shook his head and tightened his grip on the controls. His brow furrowed as he inched up in the seat. “Only someone who didn’t fly this tub in an atmosphere would ask that question.”

“This craft is a self-contained colonization ship.”

“Bah,” Isaac growled as he fought with the yoke. “I know what it is and why we created it. But it as an impossibility to construct a small city and expect it to be aerodynamic.” He bit his lower lip as the control pulled to the left.

With a grin, Jasmine crooked her finger. “Weren’t you the pilot who claimed you could fly anything?” She chuckled and added, “I’m fairly certain that was you, making the boast to Quinn.”

“Yeah,” Isaac groaned “I may have been boasting to shut Olyver up.”
