“Dolman is rethinking his allegiance,” Roland said as he ushered Darren through a doorway. Roland’s fierce gaze swept across his minions, scattering them. He followed Darren and pulled the door shut behind him. “Dolman’s rebelling because you refused to help.”

Darren strode across the room and snatched a book from the desk. He flicked it open and perused the contents, “I doubt your most devoted lackey is about to cause problems for you.”

“Don’t count on his initial fear keeping him in check.”

Darren snapped the tome closed, walked behind Roland’s desk, and plopped into the chair. He tossed the ledger next to the pile and selected another from the stack. Darren leaned back in the seat and thumbed through pages. Halfway through the volume, Darren grinned. He dropped the book, spinning it around, “We’ll discuss Dolman later.” Darren slid the ledger towards Roland, tapping the page, “But there’s something more pressing.”

“What’s more vital than a traitor?”

Darren lifted the leger and tapped his fingertip against an entry. “Just a couple of weeks ago, you stormed into my room at the Academy, demanding that I toss my education aside to come down here and help with a job.”
