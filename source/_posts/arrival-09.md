“What happened to finishing the train tracks later today?” Marcus demanded as he slammed Nathaniel’s door.

As Nathaniel slummed into his chair, he yanked on his hair. “That was the original timeline.”

“That was three months ago,” Marcus grumbled, plopping down across from Nathaniel. He reached out and grabbed the uneaten part of the sandwich. He tore a chunk off and munched on it while asking, “What shattered that lofty goal of yours?”

Nathaniel rose his head and gripped his chin. His eyes narrowed as the meal diminished. Nathaniel took a shallow breath and started rubbing his face. “We’ve had some complications along the length of the track.”

“Oh,” Marcus mocked around a mouthful. “You don’t say.”

“That’s enough,” Nathaniel cried out as his hand slammed down on his desk.

The sandwich froze halfway to Marcus’s lips, and he swallowed the remnants in his mouth before taking another bite.

Nathaniel worked his jaw loose and refolded his hands on the desk. “Are you planning to do anything other than mock me?”
