With [Simple Pleasures](archives/2020/08/15/simple-pleasures) and [Uninvited Guest](/archives/2020/08/27/uninvited-guest) finished, I turned my attention to the last piece of flash fiction for August, Science Fiction. Just like with Fantasies, I love Science Fiction because it gives me an open-ended playground to work with. That benefit is also the biggest drawback to the genres. The canvas is blank. So, once again, I turned to [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com) for inspiration once more. While browsing through the catalog for science fiction, I stumbled upon [Self-propelled general-purpose work platform](https://www.deviantart.com/ricebirdmon/art/Self-propelled-general-purpose-work-platform-848361255) by [Ricebirdmon](https://www.deviantart.com/ricebirdmon).<!-- more -->

While I took some liberties from the source image, the concept of a battle suit jumped to the forefront of my mind. From there, I wove Wendy’s story together. Unlike Uninvited Guests, Wendy’s narrative was not as forthcoming. Its storyline took some unexpected turns, but instead of trying to rein it in to the original plan, I allowed the story to unfold piece by piece. Pull up a chair and get comfortable to follow Wendy’s escape.

A young woman, disenchanted with her life, steals a prototype battle suit and rushes headlong for freedom. Will she escape or be captured…

Boom!

Wendy jumped to her feet, pulling a scope from her pack as the ground quivered. She scanned the horizon while her other hand reached back, groping for her battle suit’s metal frame.

Boom!

Another thud ripped through the sky as a collection of pebbles rattled in their outcropping. As the ground continued to quake, Wendy stowed her viewing device and scampered to her exoskeleton’s ladder.

Boom!

With a glance over her shoulder, Wendy clambered up into her cockpit. As she stood on her seat, her fingers gripped the canopy’s handles.

Boom!

She dropped into the chair and slammed the canopy into place, silencing the thunderclaps. Her hands flew across the console, activating the battle suit as something crested a nearby hill. A series of curses escaped her lips while she continued bringing her machine to life. As power flowed into the suit, the clear canopy darkened, transitioning into a view of the outside, complete with a tactical overlay.
