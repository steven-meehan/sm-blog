Dolman stumbled into Randall’s office. When he steadied himself, he whirled around, glaring at the individual standing in the opening. His snarl intensified as he brushed his shoulders. “Who do you think you are?”

The lithe figure closed the distance and whispered, “I’m Randall’s top lieutenant.” He pressed his index finger into Dolman’s forehead and pushed, “You’re one of the vast and useless minions.”

“Don’t get cocky, Markus.” The stocky dwarf swatted the man’s hand off his head. Dolman shoved the other man away from him and barred his teeth. “Positions change as the river of time progresses.”

“While there’s truth to that,” Markus said, inching closer to the stout figure. “Your place isn’t about to alter.” He placed his palm on Dolman’s chest. “And even for someone as limited as you, the purpose of this meeting, should be self-evident.” Markus shoved Dolman further into the room and left, slamming the door behind him.

“Markus is correct.” Randall steepled his fingers under his chin and smirked. “Do you understand why I summoned you?”

Dolman’s shoulders sagged as he dragged his feet toward the chair opposite Randall. He gripped its back while his lips twisted into a smirk. “Isn’t it about time to drop this charade?”
