Rylan lounged in the pilot seat and stared out the windshield. As he waited for select members of the crew to arrive, his fingers tapped the console. After a moment’s reflection, he withdrew the small data crystal from his pocket and placed it in front of the light source. The illumination penetrated the tiny and translucent stone rod, letting its blue tint shine.

The door opened, and Darvan knocked on the wall. “Boss everyone’s on board.”

With a nod, Rylan clenched his fingers around the gem and spun to face the gigantic man. “Excellent, I’ll come down shortly. But I need you to finish the emergency protocols.”

“You don’t want me there for the meeting?” Darvan asked as he leaned against the doorframe.

“No,” Rylan answered as he stashed the crystal in his pocket. “You know the plan well enough, and besides, I’m doing everything I can to keep you off the Captain’s radar.”

With a chuckle, Darvan muttered, “You appear competent in that regard.”

“Has anyone bothered you while you’ve been working?”

The sizeable man shook his head.
