Darren drew a handful of letters out of his box and hurried up the stairs. As he emerged from the stairwell, Darren flipped through the missives. He ignored the pair from his parents, but smiled when he found his friend’s handwriting. With a grin, he stuffed his parent’s notes into a pocket and opened Randall’s. He removed the paper and shoved the door open with his shoulder.

Maxwell turned around, leaning against his chair. “What are you reading, Darren?”

“A letter,” Darren muttered, waving the missive as he crossed the room and slipped into his desk. Darren pressed the note to his chest, adding, “I left your mail in the box.”

“Who’s it from?” Maxwell asked, twirling a pencil.

Darren lifted an eye and glowered over the paper. “Does it matter?”

“No,” Maxwell replied through a lopsided smile. He leaned over the chair and pointed towards the door. “I’m just looking to strike up a conversation, you’ve been spending all your time with Wayne.”

“You don’t like him,” Darren commented as he lowered the letter. “I thought you were keen on judging people after getting to know them.”
