When I finished writing [*Burnout*](/archives/2020/12/19/burnout), I turned my attention to the second piece for my patrons, a Drama. When I collected the results of the poll, [*It's A Wonderful Life*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/) must have been in my mind because I gripped that thread and let my mind build a tale off that premise. While I knew the rough strokes of the narrative, I needed to flush out the details. So, I turned to NYC Midnight and plucked a random Drama prompt, placing my tale in front of a foreclosed home. When my fingers started typing, my mind twisted the required prosthetic into a pair of crutches, but thankfully I’m not submitting this to judges.<!-- more --> Sit down and get comfortable as we delve into the story.

A man on crutches silently stares at his foreclosed home on Christmas Eve. A stranger intrudes upon his misery as tears swell in his eye...

A gray-haired man limped across the snow on his crutches to a sign. He leaned against them and reached out to lift the plastic foreclosure notice. A tear ran down his cheek and tumbled to the ground. The soft powder swallowed the droplet as he dropped the notification. He gripped his supports and inched to the stairs leading up to the door.

“It’s a shame that the owner lost such a beautiful home.”

The man turned and found an average gentleman bundled in a puffy winter coat. “Do you make a habit of bothering complete strangers?”

He chuckled and pulled a glove off, and with a warm smile, he offered the limping man his hand. “I’m sorry, sir, my name’s Jacob, and I thought you were looking for company.”

“What made you think that?”

Jacob sighed as he put his glove on while the hobbling man spun back to the house. “You’re an injured man standing in the snow and staring at a foreclosure notice on Christmas Eve. It’s obvious you are upset, and I suspect you were friends with the homeowner?”
