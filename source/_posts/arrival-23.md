Talia’s fingertips traced the wall as she sauntered toward her husband’s confiscated office and its guard. “Vincent, did Marcus demote you to a doorman?”

The large man chuckled as he laid his head against the wooden surface, while his fingers crept to his brow. “Morning, Talia. How are you doing today?”

“Aside from my annoyance, I’m doing well.”

He reached over his shoulder, touching the worn wood with his knuckles. “Correct me if I am wrong, but aren’t you supposed to be back east, with the land and little ones?”

“In an ideal world, my husband and I would both be home.” Talia stopped in front of Vincent and rolled to the tips of her toes, wrapping her arms around the large man’s neck. She kissed his cheek and dropped back to her feet. “I was content living with my family, and when I got bored our animals kept me busy. Unfortunately, Kethra couldn’t deal with that.”
