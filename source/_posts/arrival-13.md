“He’s in a meeting,” Amelia said, stepping in front of Nathaniel’s door, “he wants no interruptions.”

Marcus gripped the woman’s shoulders and moved her out of his way. “I doubt Nathaniel is talking with anybody important enough to keep me waiting.”

She slipped out of his hands and stepped between Marcus and the entrance. As a scowl formed, she placed her hand on his chest. “No, Nathaniel doesn’t want anyone, especially you, to interrupt his current meeting.”

Marcus wiped his face as a sigh rushed out. “Amelia, normally, I’d be happy to wait.” He reached out and eased her away from the door and wrapped his hands around the knob. “But there is a significant issue that requires his immediate attention.”

The moment Marcus opened the office, Nathaniel’s voice ripped through the quiet antechamber. “Amelia, I told you not to let anyone interrupt this meeting!”

Marcus pushed his head into the room, ignoring the lady sitting across from Nathaniel, and offered a lopsided grin. “Don’t blame her.” Without waiting for a reply, Marcus slipped inside, closing the door. He sauntered to the bar and froze when he identified the woman. “Kethra, do not mind me. I’ll pour myself a drink and wait patiently here.”
