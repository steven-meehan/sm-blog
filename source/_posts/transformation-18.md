When [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano) began this year, I was determined to win the competition, like last year. Unfortunately, while I won last year and somehow squeezed my Patreon flash fiction in under the wire, I did not publish any of my [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/StevenMeehan) series. This year I was resolute in achieving a different outcome. When the first day of November rolled around, I picked up my keyboard and started marching forward, guiding my latest project. While this book is far from complete (I’m only halfway through the novel) I won my second consecutive NaNoWriMo.<!-- more -->

Thankfully, that wasn’t my only success for the month. With focus and dedication, I finished my Patreon exclusives ([*Hearth*](/archives/2020/11/13/hearth), [*Strands*](/archives/2020/11/18/strands), and [Intuition](/archives/2020/11/28/intuition/)) and published all five of my Wattpad stories, including Itinerary, the latest installment of [*Transformation*](https://www.wattpad.com/story/195777713-transformation).

The last time we visited the world of Aurora, Isaac groused about his relegation to a glorified taxi service. To cope with the depression, Isaac capitalized on his [wager](/archives/2020/08/31/transformation-16/) with Jasmine. But one night, before he could start claiming his prize, Quinn summons him for a meeting with the triumvirs. So, the salty pilot marches into their office to find himself alone with Quinn. Will Isaac suffer the wrath of the Triumvir? Or has Quinn convinced the other triumvirs to improve Isaac’s life?

The door swung open, and Isaac’s eyes crept into the triumvir’s office. He swept his gaze past Quinn, looking at Caitlin’s empty seat, and then he checked on Olyver’s chair. With a grin, Isaac slipped in, sealed the room, and leaned against the wall. “Should I worry about the missing members of the triumvirate for this meeting? Dare I hope for pleasant news?”

Quinn grinned as he collected a series of pads, “Take a load off.”

“Why am I here?” Isaac asked as he scurried toward the seat. Once within arm’s reach he gripped its back, as his eyes narrowed, “I feel like a raw recruit reporting for a reprimand.”

Quinn flicked his gaze up as he pointed at the armchair. “Would you just sit down?”

“I’d prefer you explain my summons.”

“We need to talk,” Quinn selected a pad and lifted it. “Now, take a seat and read this.”
