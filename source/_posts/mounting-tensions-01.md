While writing Fortunes, I came to enjoy learning about Rylan during his trials and journey to Laria. The character grew and stuck with me, and I knew that Rylan’s story was incomplete. Thankfully, with my various notes presented me with another opportunity to further delve into Rylan’s life. Towards the end of Fortunes, the crew of the ship had a fundamental split in ideology, and that split would take seed back on their homeworld and continue to grow. While I’m eager to delve into Rylan’s life, this new narrative picks up fifteen years after the events of [Final Plans](/archives/2020/05/25/fortunes-20-final-plans).<!-- more -->

A decade and a half after the expedition to Laria, Rylan, Anabelle, and her father have been guiding Tergara to new heights. Unfortunately, the Captain from that mission, Liam, does not share their goals. He and his followers are seeking to wrest control away from the traditionalists like Annabelle's father. This new movement's goal will transform Tergara into the capitol of a new empire based on military strength. But the traditionalists will do everything in their power to prevent this transformation.

During the previous fifteen years, the Captain has sought to embed himself into the Tergaran government championing changes to weaken the established party. His latest ploy is to alter the claim that the accident which destroyed the rest of the Larian Federation was a malicious act. Join Rylan and Annabelle as they seek a to deal with the thorn in their side.

Rylan lifted a stylus from his desk and spun to face the window on his right. The piece of plastic twirled between his fingers as he stared out the glass, taking in the magnificent view. The framed forest swayed while rays of sunlight poked through the canopy.

“You look so serious.”

Rylan’s fingers clutched around the implement as he spun, finding Annabelle leaning against the door frame of his study. With a smile, he laid the stylus down and folded his hands. “These days, I’m always somber.”

With a snort, Annabelle walked behind Rylan and started rubbing his neck, while she placed her mouth next to an ear. “You’ve been thoughtful since the day we met.”

“Trying to argue that will make me a liar.” Rylan’s fingers grabbed hers and squeezed, “So I’ll say the reasons for my thoughtfulness have changed.”

“I remember the weight dumped on your shoulders.” She pulled a hand from his grip and reached out for the tablet on the desk.
