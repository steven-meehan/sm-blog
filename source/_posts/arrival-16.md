As my wedding races toward me, my mind keeps getting pulled in about thirty different directions. While I’ve always intended to publish stories on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/StevenMeehan) monthly, last month, the things I needed to do for that special day kept me from getting any tale published in September. And while those responabilites will continue to grow as the big day continues its march, I fully plan on publishing all five narratives in October. Unlike some of my previously busy months, instead of back loading my posts this time I’m planning on posting each of them over the next two weeks, so I can enjoy my wedding.<!-- more -->

After discovering the power cells stored in the bowels of the Novus, Marcus and his team collected their bounty and hiked back the way they came. Eager to return to his farm, Marcus leads everyone through the scavenged remains of the wrecked spacecraft. But as the expedition neared the end of their brief journey, the burden of lugging Nathaniel’s treasure from floor to floor wore at Marcus’s mental state. The combination of the bulky collection and his dread of being ambushed by the pirates broke his grip on his sanity. Will the wayward brigands prevent Marcus from returning to his land? Or will Marcus’s companions mock him for his concern?

Vincent twisted his head as his lips raced into a smile, “I can see daylight behind you.”

Marcus’s lips curled into a snarl as his muscles quivered, hauling the power cells, “Good for you.” As Marcus pulled the weight, beads of sweat rolled down his brow. “But I’d prefer getting back to the settlement before anything unexpected happens.” 

“What a whiner,” Vincent grumbled, popping his head through the hole.

A curse erupted from Marcus as the rope slipped through his grip. His knees slammed into the floor as his fingers tightened around the rope, “Get up here and take over!”

“Marcus, you need to relax.”

The course line slid through Marcus’s grasp, rubbing his skin, “Not everything’s value is apparent. Now remove the dead weight from my hands.”
