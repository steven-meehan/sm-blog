Wayne’s first lesson with Volodar arrives, and Maxwell and Roland are present. Darren initially hopes that Volodar tapped him to progress to the more advanced martial arts lessons. But Maxwell reminds him that Volodar is unlikely to promote Darren to those classes. The two advanced students quickly comment that they are present only to assist in Wayne’s assessment.<!-- more --> Will Wayne prove to be a competent fighter? Or will he be pummeled with his initial combat?

Darren leaned against the back wall of the dojo and watched as Wayne entered. He tapped Maxwell with a hand, whispering, “I thought Volodar preferred not forcing his students into remedial activities?”

“He doesn’t,” Maxwell elbowed Darren’s stomach and smirked. “Remember, you are not in Volodar’s advanced class. Roland and I are here for a singular reason.” Maxwell craned his neck as he studied Wayne’s motions. “I’m not sure he’ll ever tap you for those lessons.”

“You’re probably right.” Darren folded his arms over his chest and groaned. “Not that I care about that man’s approval, but should I assume we’re gathered to establish Wayne’s baseline.”

Roland draped one arm around Darren’s shoulder and his other across Maxwell’s. With a covert look at the other students, he pulled them in closer. “Without a doubt, otherwise, Maxwell and I wouldn’t have been dragged into this class.”

Maxwell peeled Roland’s limb off and smirked. “Even if Volodar presented me with the opportunity to put Wayne into his place, I’m not sure I’d take it.”

“Relax, we won’t be the first to fight our newest student. Remember, this is Wayne’s assessment process. There’s a chance he’s a better fighter than either of you believe.”
