After failing to save her employer. Kameron lay dead at Sylvia's feet, and she tried to chase after the assassin. Unfortunately for her, a guard's arrow rendered her unconscious. Waking up in a dungeon, Sylvia needs to escape. It is the only way to discover the root of the conspiracy that ended with Kameron's death. 

The master of shadows faces insurmountable odds. Will she escape a dungeon designed to contain rouge wizards? If she can will she ever discover the leader of the conspiracy? And of course, the question of the assassin's identity looms over her.
