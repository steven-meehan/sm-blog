A few months back, one of my friends suggested that I should look at [NaNoWriMo](https://www.nanowrimo.org).  After my examination, I joined the site, and I'm planning on using November to fully flesh out an upcoming project.  I'm eagerly looking forward to this experience, and while I examined the site, I stumbled upon [Camp NaNoWriMo](https://campnanowrimo.org/).  I'm currently in the middle of this year's Camp, and I am having a blast working on Hero Call.  While working on my camp project, I stumbled upon the camp's sponsors, one of which is [Wattpad](httsp://www.wattpad.com). <!-- more -->

I didn't dig into the company at the time, but my fiancé suggested that I take a look at the platform, so I went to their site and started to explore.  After going through the website, I saw just how large the platform is.  There are a lot of books on the platform, and there appears to be a vast collection of readers.  Walking through the process of creating a book, Wrattpad suggests that a cover will help attract attention, and they have a partnership with [Desygner](https://desygner.com) to help authors create beautiful covers.
 
With a fantastic first impression, I decided to dip my toes into the platform, transitioning one of my flash fiction series to the platform.  After a brief examination of my current catalog, I decided to transition my Darren Gilbert series to Wrattpad.  After the ease at which I managed to copy it over, I'm thinking about moving more of my work, including Harrison & Sylvia, to the new platform as well.  
 
I will continue to notify my readers to the new release of Darren Gilbert's saga through my website and social media.  Please check out Wrattpad to explore another rich source of literature to explore, and while you're there, keep an eye out on [my collection](https://www.wattpad.com/user/StevenMeehan).
