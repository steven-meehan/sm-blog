Rylan sat down at his desk and opened a direct connection to Annabelle’s cabin. The screen flashed up with Annabelle’s face, and Rylan grinned. “Are you prepared for the escape?”

“First,” Annabelle muttered as she lifted a gem. “Tell me how you got this crystal into my quarters.”

With a smile, Rylan tapped his chin. “I’ll give you one guess.”

“You had Darvan deliver this,” she groaned, striking her forehead with her palm.

“Not just yours,” Rylan admitted. “He deposited a copy to everyone on the shuttle.”

Annabelle tossed the gem into the air and caught it as it plummeted. “You planned on the Captain breaking up that meeting.”

“Yes,” Rylan said, lifting his back. He grabbed some stuff off his desk and shoved them into the bag. “With as volatile as he and the rest of the crew have become, they needed to stop anything.”
