As I worked on a much larger storyline, I created lots of notes bringing more backstory to the larger whole. One of those notes was about a part of the society that became lost as they approached a planet they intended to seed life on. When they entered the planet’s atmosphere the ship’s power stopped reaching its destinations. I’m sure the core of that note stemmed from Paradise, an episode from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine’s second season. While the episode centers on a planet where technology doesn’t work, the similarities cease there. Unlike those settlers, the survivors of the Novus refuse to remain trapped on the planet.<!-- more -->

However, the leader of the ship, Nathaniel, understands that despite trying to reclaim their technology, they would die if they also didn’t focus on surviving without all their advancements. So, each installment of Arrival has dealt with this balancing act, and while they haven’t discovered a way off their new planet, they have prospered, rediscovering tools that were lost centuries before their crash landing. While this collection of stories is coming to a close, those initial notes have spawned so much more for me to capture in future storylines.

But that’s enough exposition. Over the last few months [*Discussions*](/archives/2020/07/08/arrival-14/), [*Exploration*](/archives/2020/08/10/arrival-15/), and [*Return Journey*](/archives/2020/10/13/arrival-16/) have been focused on a plan hatched by the best and brightest of the Novan scientists. This month our attention will be centered on a conversation between Nathaniel and his confidant, Marcus, while those scientists seek to find the answers to their escape from their temporary home.

Nathaniel clapped Marcus’s back, “What are you worried about?”

“I can’t believe you’re asking me that question.” Marcus shrugged out of his friend’s grasp and turned around to lean against the glass. He jerked his thumb toward the eager scientists buzzing about a power cell. “You shoved a dozen of the best scientists in there and ordered them to tinker with a volatile power source. And you wonder why I’m worried?” Marcus crossed his arms and glared at Nathaniel out of the corner of his eye. “Since when did you require me to be that explicit.”

Marcus rested an arm against the window as he scratched the stubble invading his chin. “Nothing of value is ever achieved without taking risk. Fortunately, they’re aware of the danger.”

“Personally, I think racing down this path isn’t worth it.” Marcus chewed his lower lip as he stared at the scrambling scientists, “There are safer alternatives.”

“But none that would generate the success required to flee this world.” Nathaniel slammed his hand against the wall, “And you know that.”

A scientist approached, tapped the window, and thrust his finger towards the exit. Marcus grabbed Nathaniel’s arm and tugged him in the indicated direction. “It appears they don’t appreciate that disruption. Walk with me to the station.”
