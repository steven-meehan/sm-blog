When last we left off with the survivors of the Novus, Nathaniel was trying to enlist Marcus to assist the scientists’ recent request. Having obtained Marcus’s consent, Nathaniel pulled together the team to explore the ruins of the Novus and arranging their transportation. After securing his home and ranch, Marcus boarded a train and traveled to the Southern Region. Nathaniel greeted him at the station and introduced him to his team.<!-- more --> Will Marcus’s team find the requested technology? Or will the ship prove to be utterly barren of power cells?

Marcus lifted his hand through the hole and waived it until someone handed him a torch. With it in hand, Marcus dropped to the floor, allowing the flickering flame to illuminate his surroundings. “I can already tell this level is a bust, secure another ladder before you follow. While you’re doing that, I’ll search for the next place to cut through.”

“On it,” a gruff voice answered.

Marcus shook his head as he started walking down the hall. As he neared a bend in the hallway, a voice pulled him to a halt. “Marcus, we’re about a dozen decks beneath the surface of the water. It’s not wise to split up again.”

Marcus pointed down the corridor, staring at the various things reflecting the torchlight. Without turning around, he waved the man forward. “Forget what I said, it appears this level might have more promise than I initially believed.”

“Do you see a power cell?” the gruff voice asked.

“Vincent,” Marcus barked as he continued down the hall, “Everyone needs to get down here on the double.”
