The moment I published [Enticing Vision](/archives/2020/06/10/enticing-vision), I started looking through the headlines to come up with the basis for the Political Satire for June. This time I pushed past the big topics, diving deeper into the news, searching for a headline that spoke to me. During the search, I stumbled upon one that mentioned states were suing twenty-six drug makers for generic prescription price fixing, and I latched onto it.

With the political side of the tale locked in, I started thinking about the storyline that would frame the topic.<!-- more --> But without a clear starting point, the story refused to start. So as always, when I’m having trouble coming up with the initial idea, I turned to NYC Midnight and their wonderful list of prompts. This time the random prompt I plucked required me to place the narrative at a Yoga Studio and to include a motorcycle.

Once I established the rough framework for the narrative, the rest of the details flowed effortlessly from my mind. Pull out your comfy chair and hunker down to read my latest Political Satire.

Ava and Camila are the only students in Ethan’s yoga class, and as they wait for their tardy instructor, they talk about the cost of living…

As the motorcycle’s engine died, Camila extended the kickstand and laid her helmet against the handles. “How are you doing, Ava?”

“Isn’t it time to drive something reasonable?”

“What’s wrong with my bike?” Camila winked as she dismounted and tapped the seat. “I keep telling you if you tried riding a motorcycle, you’d enjoy the experience.”

A shudder ran down Ava’s spine as she covered her lips. She closed her eyes and took several deep breaths. “There’s no way you’ll ever get me on one of those obnoxious contraptions. They’re too dangerous.”

Camila grabbed her helmet, flipping the visor up and threaded her arm through the opening. She plopped into the chair next to Ava, placing the protective headgear into her lap as her head whipped up and down the street. “I take it Ethan hasn’t shown up yet?”

“He’s never on time.” Ava pulled a prescription bottle from her purse and shook it. She read the label and tossed the container into her bag. “Do you believe I’d be able to run to a drugstore to get my medication refilled?”
