With [Liquid Assets](/archives/2019/12/26/liquid-assets) and [Weighing an Alibi](/archives/2019/12/26/weighing-alibi) completed, I turned my attention to the third and final Patreon post for December, a Thriller. Unlike the other tales, I don’t have a character waiting in the wings. Without the benefit of character, more blanks need to fill in, so to ease the burden, I jumped to NYC Midnight’s catalog. Once there, I searched the page for the word thriller and picked a random prompt.<!-- more -->

My location came up as a bridge, and I needed to weave a mask somewhere into the story. I thought about the requirements and let my mind wander. How would I tie both these together into a compelling narrative? A bridge seemed easy enough to weave into a thriller, but how would I bring the mask into the story? Looking back at the prompt, I realized that other options existed, but ultimately I’m happy with the crafted tale. Inevitably while flash fiction tells a complete story, there always are some dangling threads. While Racing Fire is not the exception to prove the rule, I think I have some central characters to revisit the next time a Thriller comes up.

A couple are crossing a bridge to get home when something collides with the structure. As the taillights flare, they flee to survive…
