Lucas is an interesting character. I’ve dropped him into the same world as Darren Gilbert, and roughly the same timeframe. Fortunately, that world is massive, and there are plenty of places where he can fit and not interact with Darren unless I want him to. I developed the character as a response to a Micro Fiction prompt for a Ghost Story. As the mini story developed, I was excited to delve into the history and unique skill set for my main character.<!-- more -->

The inspiration for this character was Ghost Whisperer. However, instead of helping spirits cross over, Lucas creates permanent homes for his ghosts with tattoos. I’m introducing him to my readers as he’s getting his latest toot completed.

Come, sit down and allow me to give you a mini-escape and kindle your imagination.

“How are you doing, Maxwell?”

The tattooer’s forehead fell to his desk. “Lucas, why can’t I work on your tattoos during regular business hours.”

Lucas dropped a picture and a vial of black powder onto the table. He patted Maxwell’s shoulders, placing his mouth next to the artist’s ear. “My privacy is far too valuable to come during your normal schedule.”

“I’m not comfortable using mystery additives in my ink?”

“Relax, I’ve signed all your waivers.” Lucas flicked the canister and jumped into the nearest station. “Tonight’s shading, and that requires my additive.”

Maxwell seized the vial and placed the source image onto his workstation. “Pull the bandage off while I mix your particular ink.”
