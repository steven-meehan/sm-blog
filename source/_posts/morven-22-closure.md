As [Colonization](https://www.wattpad.com/story/194933430-colonization)‘s story comes to a close, I’m taking a step back and examining this story’s journey. Long before I wrote the first entry in this narrative, [Landing on Morven](https://www.wattpad.com/762038689-colonization-landing-on-morven), I crafted a history for another project. In the notebook dedicated to that world, I had a pair of throwaway lines about a colonization attempt. From those simple lines, I built a rough storyline that laid the foundation of this series. From that initial draft, the story grew, taking on a life of its own, and with several careful nudges, I explored the characters of this expedition.<!-- more --> Join me as I complete this series of exploring an unknown world.

“Hurry!” Keldon barked as he hoisted one side of the beam. “We have to fix the wall before that oncoming horde takes advantage of the opening.”

Caleb lifted the other end with a grunt. “You’d think looming devastation might grab Tarian’s attention.”

Keldon glanced behind his shoulder as he sauntered toward the breach. “That’s enough, Caleb.” Keldon hefted the slab of metal and rolled his shoulders. “Lloyd’s death hit him hard, I doubt there’s anything that would get him back into the world.” As Keldon stumbled, his eyes latched onto Caleb. “Slow down and be careful, or I’ll end up snapping my neck.”

Caleb slowed as his head swayed, “Sorry, but it’s remarkable those monsters haven’t attacked yet.”

“Be thankful for small favors.” Keldon glanced over his shoulder as the beam fought his grasp. “Wayne, please assist us in getting this bar into position.”

When the weight lessened, Keldon whipped around, finding Tarian. “Allow me to assist you with this burden. You’ve helped me carry mine lately.”
