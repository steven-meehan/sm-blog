How often do we romanticize our experiences as children?  There are a few shows that I remember doggedly following, trying never to miss a second of the story.  And looking back at them now I simply do not understand why I was so enamored with them.  I still mostly enjoy watching the shows, out of some misguided sense of nostalgia; but, the love I had for the story has long since faded.  <!-- more --><div class="embedded-image-right">![Farscape](./farscape.jpg)</div>Somehow though, there are some shows that have been able to burn just as brightly now as they did when I first glimpsed them.   Farscape was one of these special few shows.

The adventures of — no I cannot say that with a straight face, let alone type with one —  rather, the misadventures of Commander John Crichton and the criminals he helped to free were on the air for four seasons.  And for those four seasons I tuned to the SciFy Channel Friday night to watch each and every new story unfold.  Right up until the last episode; and that one made me sick to my stomach. For those who are unfamiliar with the show, when the last episode was completed “To be Continued” flashed across the screen.  I knew the show was coming to an end, I had prepared myself for it, but the ending I had been presented with was too heart wrenching.  So much so, that I had to fight with myself to keep from flushing the good memories of the show.  However, there was something I did not know at the time.  The show was originally supposed to run for five seasons.  So what should have been a preparation for the next season instead turned into an unfortunate cliffhanger. 

Despite the ending of the show’s last episode, I still have a desire to watch reruns of this truly unique and original show.  The depth and breadth of the show was, in large part, thanks to some very ingenious work on behalf of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop and, for their diligence and creativity, they should be applauded.  The show is currently available on Netflix for those who have yet to watch this crew’s misadventures in the Uncharted Territories.  Or even for those who have already witnessed them and just would like a chance to revisit those “adventures” once more.
