Roland guided an unfamiliar individual into the cafeteria. With a sigh, he bolted toward his classmates, sitting down between Maxwell and Darren. Jerking his thumb at the lithe figure behind him, Roland sighed. “Everyone, this is the Academy’s newest student, Wayne Iydril.”

The fresh face brushed blond hair out of his eyes as he pulled out the vacant seat across from Roland. Wayne lifted an eyebrow and examined each of the gathered students. “Nice to see you all.”

Roland groaned, scooping food into his bowl. He knocked the clinging bits off the utensil and pointed it toward the others. “Wayne, this is Maxwell Creegan, Darren Gilbert, Norry Haysmith, Semil Bellas, Elayne Reinfield, and Kira Ibryiil.”

While the others acknowledged the newcomer, Darren dropped his spoon into his stew and leaned against his chair. “How are you doing, Wayne?”

The young man looked down his nose at the gathered pupils, claiming the serving ladle. He eased the utensil into the thick liquid as he stirred the stew. “Is this the best cuisine we’re served?”

Darren scrunched his face and scooped a mouthful of the stew. With a flourish, he shoved it into his mouth and started speaking around the bite. “The food is delicious.”
