Fresh off Marcus's conversation with some of the rural leadership in the remnants of the Western Region, he finished his report and sent it back to Nathaniel. When the leader of this fledgling new colony received Marcus's missive, he read through the expected words. He cursed the bureaucracy that kept Kethra in power and immediately dispatched an aide to bring Talia in for a meeting.<!-- more --> Will Nathaniel request Talia travel to the Western Region to assist her husband? Or will he inform her that Marcus will be stuck in the Western Region for longer than expected?

Talia’s fingers wrapped around the edge of the tattered door. With a deep breath, she shoved the worn wood, and it slammed into the far wall. Nathaniel’s eyebrows climbed while Talia tapped on the damaged frame. “You realize other buildings suffered more devastation and have been repaired. Why haven’t you approved the restoration of your building?”

Nathaniel buried his eyes into a hand as he lifted a sheet of paper. “There are more pressing concerns than having my office door replaced.”

“There’s always an excuse.” Talia shook her head and sauntered to the open chair. She slipped into it and plucked the report from Nathaniel’s grip and gestured at the destruction. “You are the leader of this coalition.” Talia laid the document on his desk and huffed. “As a result, you need to consider your appearance and requisition the repairs for this structure.”

“The damages to this building.” Nathaniel slumped as his fingers twirled about the small office. “Specifically, this room is on the list of renovations.” Nathaniel’s hand shot out like a snake, reclaiming the paper. Nathaniel returned it to the pile and his hands smoothed out the rumpled sheet. “However, the time to restore this chamber isn’t as important as the recovery and restoration of the rest of the region.”

A whistle sliced through the air as Talia gripped the corner of the document. She tugged on it and scowled when it refused to budge. “This has nothing to do with your willingness to work in this wreck.”

Nathaniel shook his head as a smile emerged. He lifted his fingers and leaned against his chair. “No, this is something else.”
