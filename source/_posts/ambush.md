Thankfully, work has settled down to a regular workload, and I have enjoyed getting back into a normal groove with my blog. So far, I’ve published [Enticing Vision](/archives/2020/06/10/enticing-vision) and [Cost of Living](/archives/2020/06/18/cost-of-living) when I planned, and I could focus on my last piece of flash fiction for the month, a Thriller. Just like I did for my fairy tale, I searched [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/) for pictures that inspired a story the moment I found it. And on Saturday, I came across [348/365 The Ritual By snatti89](https://www.deviantart.com/snatti89/art/348-365-The-Ritual-620493508) and my mind launched into motion, fleshing out the narrative.<!-- more -->

Take a few moments and study snatti89’s illustration below. The bare trees and path combined with the drab colors immediately put me on edge for the four friend’s backpacking along the trail. I instantly wanted to scream that they were in peril.

Jillian rested against a lifeless tree and pulled her canteen from her hip. She guzzled the water inside and leaned her hair against the rough bark. “Can anyone tell me why we took this stupid hike?” She shoved her bottle onto her belt and pushed against the trunk supporting her. “I mean, we had plenty of options available to us in the city. Please explain the decision to head into the middle of nowhere!”

“It’s simple, one of Raynard’s friends told him about the lake in the heart of the forest.” Norna clapped Jillian’s back and winked as she hustled ahead of the exhausted woman. She cupped her fingers around her mouth and took in a deep breath. “Jillian is taking her shift at the rear of the line.”

“I’ll make sure that Raynard swaps with Mathias, so we resume a slower pace.”

“Jillian will thank you for that, Anna.” Norna stopped and spun with her foot bouncing off the ground. When Jillian reached her, Norna wrapped an arm about her friend and pushed her forward. “I know you’re tired, but this train is spreading out.”

Jillian wiped her forehead and smacked dry lips. “Does anyone here honestly think I’m an outdoorsy gal?”

Norna pulled the canteen from Jillian’s belt and sighed. “I am unsure how much farther we have to go to reach this spectacular sight,” she shook the bottle and let the silence ring out over the wildlife.
