Between work and Christmas, December became just as hectic as November. But as Christmas approached, I knuckled down and focused on writing my Patreon posts. After the poll closed, I ended up with a Crime Caper, a Mystery and a thriller. As the twentieth came to a close, my mind started churning on what Jessica’s latest adventure might be.<!-- more -->

Still working without a full name for my master thief, I went delving for this job’s prompt. After my search, I needed to work her latest heist into a vineyard and a laminator required to make an appearance. What valuables would a vineyard have? It took me a while, but I eventually leaned on an eccentric owner and his mythical buried treasure. With everything in place, I began crafting the outline of Jessica’s latest escapade. And before long, this heist took shape. With the tale finished come explore the mysteries of this crime.

Jessica’s current job drops her in a vineyard, searching for the owner’s treasure. With no concrete information, will she ever find it…
