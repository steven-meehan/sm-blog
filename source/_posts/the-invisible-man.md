The SciFy original show, The Invisible Man, aired back in 2000.  It was a fun and campy show.  Watching you could tell that the actors had a lot of fun with each other and the show.  <!-- more -->

I wish they had been able to produce more than just the two seasons.  It would have been fun watching Darien and Bobby fight against the forces of evil that no other agency could see.  It would also be nice if the second season would ever be released on DVD.  If you ever have the opportunity to watch the show I would recommend you take it.
