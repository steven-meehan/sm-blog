While I don't remember how [The Adventures of Tom Stranger, Interdimensional Insurance Agent](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Adventures-of-Tom-Stranger-Interdimensional-Insurance-Agent-Audiobook/B01D0FJOAI) came into my Audible library, I’m fairly sure I can thank [Audible Originals](https://www.audible.com/ep/audible-originals). This relatively new service rewards members with free programs every month. Having read some of Larry Correia's works, notably his [Monster Hunter](https://www.audible.com/series/Monster-Hunter-Audiobooks/B006K1QVNS) series and the [Grimnoir Chronicles](https://www.audible.com/series/Grimnoir-Chronicles-Audiobooks/B007B4S7OE), I gave it a whirl. 

Both of the aforementioned series possess some similar aspects, but they generate an enjoyable narrative. But when I started listening to Tom Stranger's adventure, it quickly became clear that he upended the familiar recipe.<!-- more --> Instead of presenting us with a big and muscular hero, we're introduced to an average man who travels between dimensions dedicating his entire life to providing the best customer service possible. And while Larry Correia has humor in his other writing, it’s not to this extreme. 

The tale’s comedy focusses around Tom's newest intern, who isn't up to interdimensional insurance agent standards, quickly becomes a noose about our hero's neck. Through each chapter, we get front row seats to a normal day for our protagonist, who displays not just his enhanced strength but his sharp mind. Fans of Larry Correia's other work will enjoy picking up this short tale. While he doesn't go into all the typical details about the guns in his story, he delves into our hero's principal weapon and all of its capabilities.
 
The action is well done and moves at a quick pace. The comedic relief is expertly done, and while the intrepid and customer-centric insurance agent is set in his desire to deliver top-quality service to his customers, Tom's journey brings him to a moment of clarity as he deals with his newest intern.
