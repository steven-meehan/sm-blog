After dinner with his wife, Rylan met with Garvin and they started working on procuring three spaceships. As the weeks dragged on, the two politicians used all their connections and influence to secure the crafts required for their plans. With the ships secured, Garvin plots courses that would enable any pilots to bypass Liam's security while Rylan sits down to find the pilots.<!-- more --> Will Darvin agree to help Rylan's search for pilots? Or will he ignore Rylan's plea?

Darvin’s lips curled into a smile as he covered his mouth. “Rylan, you don’t call, you won’t write, I mean it’s not like you weren’t beaten into a coma.”

Rylan’s palms flew to his cheeks as he swallowed a scream. “Do not start with that. We met shortly before Liam arranged my beating.” Rylan grabbed a stylus off his desk, “Plus, Annabelle kept you in the loop.” He flung the stylus at Darvin, punctuating his statement.

The implement sailed through Darvin’s hologram and bounced off the far wall. The muscular man grinned and seized something from beside his holographic emitter. With a flourish, Darvin pressed a pen against his temple. “Is that what you were hoping for?”

“Yes,” Rylan’s arms folded over his chest, “Can we move on?”

“While there’s a lot I’ll do for you,” Darvin twirled the stylus once and dropped it. “I’m not available to become a bodyguard.”

“That’s a discussion I’m sure Annabelle would jump on,” Rylan lifted a pad. “Unfortunately, we have more pressing concerns, is your end secure?”
