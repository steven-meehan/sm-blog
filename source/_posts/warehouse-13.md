***Endless wonder***. What runs through your mind at those two words? For me, the answer is [Warehouse 13](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B002GJO6GC/ref=atv_dp). And considering just how prevalent the line is that connection makes sense. But only when you consider I finished watching the series again. I may end up buying the show through Amazon Prime, but in the meantime it’s available to stream for free with [IMDb TV](https://www.imdb.com/tv/). The only caveat with that is the sheer number of commercial breaks. The service seems to be more aggressive than other similar ones. Thankfully, the content rises above the pesky ads.<!-- more -->

<div class="embedded-image-right">![Warehouse 13](./warehouse-13.jpg)</div>As for the show, it premiered on July 07, 2009 and ran through May 19, 2014 on the ScyFi network. Despite the terrible movies they produce, their shows always seem to be well thought out and populated with amazing characters. And Warehouse 13 is not the exception that proves the rule. The show stared [Eddie McClintock](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565858/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) as Pete Lattimer, [Joanne Kelly](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1162399/?ref_=tt_cl_t2) as Myka Bering and [Saul Rubinek](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007210/?ref_=tt_cl_t3) as Artie Nelson. This core trio couldn’t have been cast any better, and their chemistry stood out from the initial scenes.

Although I’m not a huge fan of episodic shows, the writers did a marvelous job to weave in season-long arcs into those standalone episodes. By the end of the pilot, the show’s formula is defined. In fact, within the opening minutes, the tone of the series is well established with their motto. 

> “Snag it. Bag it. And tag it.”

It’s fun to watch the layering that takes place as the storytelling winds the massive arcs into its tapestry. And the stakes increase each week and every season. The writers encouraged this growth by adding wonderful characters to the series, either recurring characters or main characters. The first expansion came with the addition of Claudia Donovan portrayed by [Allison Scagliotti](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1270095/?ref_=tt_cl_t4), who brought fresh energy that never faded.

For anyone who has never seen this show, I cannot recommend Warehouse 13 enough. For those who have, I still think delving back into the mysteries of [Warehouse 13](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B002GJO6GC/ref=atv_dp) is worth the investment. Go enjoy the ***“Endless Wonder”***.
