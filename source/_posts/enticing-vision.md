When I closed the polls, I smiled at the initial genre of a Fairy Tale. Origionally I decided to go and read some classic Fairy Tales for inspiration but I ended up heading over to [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/) and searched for fairy tale images and it didn't take long before I stumbled onto [Fairy tale nearby... by Nikolaj-Arndt](https://www.deviantart.com/nikolaj-arndt/art/Fairy-tale-nearby-306145276). The moment I came across the image, my story snapped into my mind, and I knew exactly what I wanted to write. That clarity doesn't always happen when I stumble upon interesting images, but I'm happy for this happy coincedence.<!-- more -->

With the base story floating in my mind, the initial draft flowed through my fingertips. Each subsequent one helped to refine the story until I created my latest Fariy Tale. Please take a moment and appreciate the stunning beauty of the inspiration for my story. Once you have appreciated Nikolaj-Arndt's work please follow the link to Enticing Vision.

Once upon a time, a girl sulked as she walked down the street with her parents. The three of them stopped by a food cart, and a sudden cracking pulled the child’s head around as she squeezed her father’s hand. As she searched for the source of the clatter, she tugged on his shirt. “Do you hear that?”

“Only the sounds of the city,” he touched her cheek and pointed at the menu. “Would you like something else, Emma?”

As the breaking intensified, the girl jumped onto her dad’s leg. “I think the sidewalk is cracking?”

Her mother bent down and squeezed her daughter. “There’s nothing wrong with the street.” She released Emma, knocking on the concrete beneath them. With a glance up to her husband, she asked, “Should we go home?”

“It’s her overactive imagination,” he helped his wife stand up and gestured at the food truck. “I’ve already told Jeffery what Emma and I want. The sooner you place your order, the quicker we can eat.”

While the child’s mother ordered, another series of cracks roared, and the girl’s arms wrapped around her father’s leg. Despite the intensifying sounds coming from the street, the child cracked her eyes open and gaped at the small flight of stairs in front of her. She tugged her dad’s arm and nodded at the forming archway at the bottom of the stairwell.
