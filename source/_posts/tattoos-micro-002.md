Fresh after giving Samantha her permanent home, Lucas heads out to collect more of the ingredient required to craft homes for his apparitions. While I’ve only introduced a pair of Lucas’s ghosts in Tattooed Home, with this installment I’m going to hint at the collection of shades and how they’re able to assist Lucas.<!-- more -->

Besides Samantha, his newest shade, the other ghost I introduced was Ricky. And while I hinted at his personality, I’m delving into their relationship. While he’s happy with the connection to the world of the living, he refuses to assist Lucas with anything.

Come, sit down and allow me to give you a mini-escape and kindle your imagination.

“Why are you leaning over the edge of a cliff? You won’t get along with the bottom.”

Lucas smiled as he patted the precipice. He lifted his sleeve and studied Samantha’s portrait. “Don’t worry. I’ve made this trip dozens of times.”

“You do not have that many tattoos,” Ricky spat.

Lucas’s hand swatted Ricky’s picture. “Be quiet!” Lucas rose, widening his stance, and spread his arms out like wings. As he exhaled, Lucas crouched down, holding the tension in his muscles. As he drew in another breath, Lucas leapt into the abyss. Ghosts fluttered from their portraits, flapping in the wind. With a smile, he glanced at Samantha’s face. “Aside from you and Ricky, my friends help me with everything, even flying.”

“Why doesn’t Ricky assist you?”
