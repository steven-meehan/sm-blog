I woke up today with an extra bounce in my step. I haven’t felt like this ever since I published [***Dead Man's Hand***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1520247427/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1520247427&linkCode=as2&tag=mysite009e-20&linkId=18504421d9a9d640ffdaaaedda9d249c). It’s taken me far longer than I thought it would, but today I’m publishing my second book. [***Drawing Thin***](https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Thin-Forgers-Book-2-ebook-dp-B07X2Z5KZ1/dp/B07X2Z5KZ1/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) picks up right where ***Dead Man’s Hand*** left off. This book continues Francis’s journey and exploration into his powers, pitting him against another enemy. For anyone who wants to read a sample of the book to see if you’re going to buy it, you have a couple of options. The first is the sample that Amazon provides, and the second option is the sample I’ve posted on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/story/194774899-drawing-thin).<!-- more -->
