Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda is a show that premiered on October 2nd, 2000.  It stars Kevin Sorbo of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys fame, as Dylan Hunt a High Guard Captain who becomes lost in time after a surprise attack when his ship, the Andromeda Ascendant, enters a black hole in the hope to survive that attack.  As soon as his Andromeda escapes from the black hole that held them he meets the people who will ultimately form his new crew.  The show follows Dylan Hunt and his new crew as they strive to resurrect the fallen Systems Commonwealth, the republic Dylan served when he entered the black hole. <!-- more --><div class="embedded-image-left">![](./andromeda.jpg)</div>

The premise of the show did intrigue me, unfortunately for me, Andromeda aired while I was busy being obsessed with a pair of SciFi shows, The Invisible Man and Farscape.  Both of those shows captivated me and kept my attention focused squarely on them.  Though even at the time I do remember getting a few recommendations from people I knew and trusted that Andromeda was a show that I should watch.  But for whatever reason, I just didnâ€™t pay attention to those recommendations at the time.  Even more interesting to me now was the fact that I was intrigued by Kevin Sorbo as the leading actor.  I do have good (though admittedly skewed) memories of his portrayal of Hercules from when I watched that show as a younger man.  So when I came across Andromeda available as part of [Amazon Prime]( https://www.amazon.com/Under-the-Night/dp/B077JR8JQ8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1527460025&sr=8-2&keywords=andromeda+season+1), I decided to finally give Andromeda the same chance most shows deserve to get.

When I started watching Andromeda, I was instantly pulled into the series.  The characters are all well rounded and wonderfully developed, they all have their strengths and their weaknesses.  Each episode of the show moves at a good pace as it explores its plot, while the series' story develops and grows at an equally incredible pace.  The series does have a satisfying conclusion, and it is a show that I will once again sit down and become captivated by just as everyone should at least once in their lives.
