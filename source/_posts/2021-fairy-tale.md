Despite publishing [Fundraising](/archives/2021/04/26/2021-comedy/), my back is still against the wall and I’m staring down the barrel of my deadlines for April. Thankfully, I’ve had some experience with tight deadlines and each time it’s fed my creativity. As I shifted my focus to my Fairy Tale, the looming deadline wasn’t any exception. Within the first few moments, the core concept of this story crystalized. This tale is going to focus on a young boy named Luis and his unique ability to see fairies and their kin.<!-- more -->

Armed with this core tenant, I dove into NYC Midnight’s catalogue and plucked a random fairy tale prompt. A backyard is a blank canvas to work with, so I was happy with that leg of my narrative. The firecracker was a little more difficult to weave into the story. Thankfully, the time crunch sparked an idea in my head, and I ran with it. This narrative quickly turned into a buddy story with a lot of character development. Sit down and follow Luis as he educates Raine about the dangers of fireworks.

Luis and his family and friends are putting on a firework show. However, there is a special guest visible only to Luis’s eyes…

A fluttering creature tugged on Luis’s earlobe and cupping his hand around his lips. “You should pick up that strange branch and turn it on.”

Luis kept his focus on the fireworks blooming to life in the sky as his fingers shot towards the sprite. Unfortunately, they tightened about air as the sprite’s wings propelled itself out of Luis’s grasp. Luis covered his mouth and whispered, “Stop pestering me.”

The creature’s wings blurred as it drifted into the boy’s eye line. “Why’d you try to snatch me?” Drifting to the ground, the fairy’s foot tapped against the small tube. “I just wanted you to grab this odd branch.”

Luis snatched the sprite and dashed into the house’s shadow. He cracked his grip and stared at the little creature. “Raine, you know the rules.”

“Sorry,” the fairy said as his eyes rolled. “But the other large folk weren’t paying attention to you.” He twirled a finger at the display spreading above them, “They’re obsessed with those colorful explosions.”

“I’m trying to enjoy it as well.”
