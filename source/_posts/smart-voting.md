With two Patreon stories down, I focused on the last tale for January, a Political Satire. Getting these stories always is a mixed bag, because I'm not a political person. In fact I try to avoid the news altogether. But there are times when I can let some of my personal beliefs bleed through and takle particular issues.<!-- more -->

I dug into the recent headlines and came across a headline that honestly terrifies me, Smartphone Voting. Granted it's for the upcoming caucus in Iowa, but going this route is very dangerous. I know how that particular sausage is made, and it terrifies me. With the political angle buttoned down, I turned to NYC Midnight’s catalog to pluck a Political Satire prompt. Follow me as I spin a Political Satire in an all you can eat buffet and featuring a fire hose.
