Limitations are an excellent way to focus your attention on any problem. For Flash Fiction, my stories can unfold with up to one thousand words, and I’ve gotten better with that pacing. Unfortunately, for Micro Fiction, that cap is quartered. With only 250 words, I’m constantly analyzing and considering if I’m using the correct word. With so few of them available for the story, everything has to build toward the payoff. The only wrinkle with serialized fiction (something that follows a broad story arc) is the need to connect them to the growing narrative.<!-- more -->

While I haven’t explored Ramas and Nilus’s abilities, I’ve hinted at them. This entry will focus on the major side effect that accompanies their special skills. As we continue to explore these individuals, the reasons behind the corruption will be revealed. But for now, Ramas and Nilus are meeting for the first time after agreeing to never see each other again.

Come, sit down and allow me to give you a mini-escape and kindle your imagination.

As Ramas’s earthen palanquin touched down, it sent a burst of wind in every direction, knocking over a collection of vials. “Why’d you summon me?” 

“I’m surprised you announced yourself.” 

“What did you do with my messenger?” 

Nilus waved one hand while his other tightened into a fist. As Nilus lifted it, the liquid rose, forming a swirling mass. “He bears your mark, you tell me.” 

“However, I cannot sense him?” 

Laughter filled the air between them as the fluid contracted to a single point. “I have an attachment with the entire town, which is where he’s relaxing. But we have important matters to discuss.”
