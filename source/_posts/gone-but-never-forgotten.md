It’s been almost a year and a half since my last post.  And it’s been a crazy time for me, a lot has been going on in my life recently.  But now that it’s calming down a little I’m back and with my return I’m bringing my first published novel with me, Dead Man’s Hand.  <!-- more -->For most of the stories I still have rattling around in my head i know how they came about, or at least what inspired them. But with Dead Man’s Hand, I don’t remember what the catalyst was. Not that it matters to me that much in the end. I have been working on Dead Man’s Hand off an on since June of 2012 and during that time the novel took a lot of twists and turns in its development, and was a lot of fun to write.  And I hope people have as much fun reading it as I had bringing it to life. It is {% link 'available on the Kindle' 'http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Mans-Hand-Steven-Meehan-ebook/dp/B00TTXVQ7A/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1424810164&sr=8-7&keywords=dead+mans+hand' %} now for pre-order and will be available to read on March 1st 2015.
