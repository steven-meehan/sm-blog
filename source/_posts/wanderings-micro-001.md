Story telling is important, no matter the format. A story that spans hundreds of thousands or words, while more substantial than one of two hundred and fifty, isn’t inherently more important. A story is more than the sum of its words. It’s an escape from the every day. And I hope to bring more of these mini-escapes to my audience. While there are many competing storylines rolling around my head, I don’t have an endless supply of time.<!-- more -->

So I end up choosing my projects for a couple of reasons. First, how quickly I can complete it. And second, who are my compelling characters. I have not abandoned my novels. In fact, I’m eager to share Francis’s next journey with everyone. Unfortunately, the time required to finish the next project continues to elide me. Thankfully, my Flash Fiction posts, and now the Micro Fiction ones allow me to sharpen my wit and diction constantly, liking the characters allows me to have my cake and eat it too. &#128522;

As I hunkered down with my tablet, one of my many storylines inspired my fingers and I created an interesting character. By the time I finished crafting the image, I had enough of the character to place him into the wider setting I carved out for people with his abilities. Come, sit down and allow me to give you a mini-escape and kindle your imagination.

The man wiped blood from the corner of his lips and glared into Ramas’s milky white eyes. “You’re tougher than you appear.” 

Ramas twirled his fingers and pointed to the sky. Instantly, the opponent jumped to his feet and his hands clawed at his mouth. Ramas stepped in front of the fool, shoving his face next to his. “Unlike the rest of my kind, I’m not seeking an empire.”
