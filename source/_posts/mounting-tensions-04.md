All month long, I’ve been contemplating about the whys behind all my series on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/StevenMeehan). So in the continued spirit of [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano), let me take you behind the scenes with [*Mounting Tensions*](https://www.wattpad.com/story/229837636-mounting-tensions). I remember penning the overview for the previous series, [*Fortunes*](https://www.wattpad.com/story/195320038-fortunes), and while the story kept the main shape, it definitely took on a shape of its own. The biggest surprise that Rylan and his companions threw my way was the romance between the technician and Annabelle. I planned on coming back to that world eventually, but the couple provided me an opportunity I couldn’t ignore. With this new series, I’d be able to explore an aspect of their world between the events of Fortunes and the next planned storyline.<!-- more -->

Previously on [*Mounting Tensions*](https://www.wattpad.com/969344469-mounting-tensions-ambush "Ambush"), the protagonist from Fortunes is ambushed on a stroll through the city. Meanwhile, his father-in-law greats his daughter, wondering where Rylan is. The two share a brief conversation about the recent uptick in the beatings of the Traditionalist party while they wait for Rylan to return home. Will Rylan be brought home? Or has he become another statistic?

“Where is your better half?” Garvin asked, removing his jacket and folding it over the back of a chair. He sat down across from his daughter, rubbing his chin. “He was supposed to meet me here, so we could discuss some upcoming legislation.”

Annabelle dropped her hands into her lap as she slouched into the deep seat. “I’m not sure where he’s hiding.”

“Have you tried reaching out to him?”

“Twice so far,” Annabelle said through a series of sniffles. She pulled the pad from beside her and whimpered at the lack of messages. “It’s only troubling because of Rylan’s punctuality.”

Garvin took the device from her hands and placed it on the table. “Have you contacted the authorities?”

Annabelle shook her head as her fingernails dug into her arms. “Rylan must have gotten distracted with something more pressing. There’s no need to start a kerfuffle because he’s running late.”
