With [Choices](/archives/2020/07/28/choices) and [Check Up](/archives/2020/07/30/check-up) having been published, I turned my attention to the last story for the month of July, my Political Satire. I scrubbed through the headlines, searching for an appropriate article to serve as the basis of my tale.

“I’m hungry, and you were supposed to meet me at Sal’s Diner.” Jacob closed the door and dashed to the chair next to Wilson, plopping into it as he seized the pad. He looked at the deposit and grinned. Dropping the tablet, he leaned back and stared up at the ceiling. “How can you be so miserable after getting that amount of money? What are you planning on doing with that government handout?”

Wilson lifted a finger and twirled it over his head as he slumped into his chair.

“There’s no pleasing you, is there?”

“Oh, I’m a simple man to please.” Wilson pushed himself away from his desk and laced his fingers in his lap. “If Liam hadn’t pressed for that senseless resettlement program, then we wouldn’t have needed that stupid handout...
