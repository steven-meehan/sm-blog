Darren’s head whipped toward the opening cafeteria door. He held his cup of tea under his nose and took a deep breath of the fragrant drink, as he watched Maxwell walk into the cafeteria with a strange woman. Darren lowered his mug and gripped Lia’s forearm. “Did the Academy get another student or has Maxwell started dating?”

“What?” Lia closed her book onto her forefinger and licked her lips. “I have heard no gossip concerning a fresh face.” Lia shrugged, tapping the table, “I also didn’t think Maxwell cared about women.”

Darren shook his head and sipped his tea. “Max definitely prefers to throw himself into his studies.”

When Maxwell’s eyes found Darren, he spun around, retreating from the dining complex. But the stout woman’s hand shot out and snatched his wrist, pulling him to a halt. She turned to the food and dragged a struggling Maxwell toward it. Once there, she released Maxwell’s arm and grabbed a plate. She pressed it against her chest with a forearm and squeezed his shoulders, whispering something into his ear. Reluctantly Maxwell reached out and lifted a dish from the stack.

With a chuckle, Darren pointed at the pair, “Whoever she is, that woman can handle Maxwell.”

Lia’s eyes widened as she twisted in her seat. Leaning against the chair, Lia watched the pair pile steak and vegetables onto their plates before turning back to Darren with a broad grin. She wrapped her hands around her own mug and her smile wavered.
