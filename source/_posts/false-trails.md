Well, my original plans for getting all my posts published by October 24th fell short. But despite my life not allowing me to comply with that lofty goal, I will have all three flash fiction stories published for October. The first tale for this month is a Fantasy, and I decided to continue with Darren’s adventure from September, [Ensnared](/archives/2020/09/29/ensnared/). While any patron can read this month’s entry without reading [Ensnared](/archives/2020/09/29/ensnared/), you should give it a read as well.<!-- more -->

While [Journeys](https://www.wattpad.com/story/193730653-darren-gilbert-journeys) details my wizard’s early life, I’ve used my Patreon exclusives to explore aspects of the adult wizard’s life. The purpose behind [Ensnared](/archives/2020/09/29/ensnared/) was to demonstrate the power of the Hunters. And while I hinted at their abilities, I emphasized their reach and dedication to tracking down rogue wizards like Darren. That said, Darren is my hero, and the Hunters are his nemesis, so head over to my Patreon page to become a patron and discover Darren’s latest plan.

Having confirmed his stoolie’s loyalty, Darren searches for his informant. Will Darren be able to pass his false information to the Hunters…

With a groan, Darren pulled his buzzing phone from his pocket and answered the call, “Randall, why are you bothering me?”

“Darren, you’re late! Please tell me you’re on your way and roughly when we can expect your arrival.”

“You’re well aware of my plans for tonight,” Darren sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Can’t you stop interfering with my arrangements?”

“If you made the correct choices, I’d be happy to leave you alone. Unfortunately, feeding the Hunters false intelligence isn’t as important as an active social life.”

Darren’s palm slammed into his forehead as a groan wheezed out of him like air streaming from a balloon. He stared at the luminous stars through his fingers as they traveled down his face. “If supplying the Hunters didn’t require so much of my attention, I might choose to squander some of it for your social gatherings.” Darren dropped his gaze to the construction site and reached into his jacket, tracing a smooth edge, “When it’s done the ground floor better be publicly accessible.”

“With the construction happening, I figured you would’ve selected a more suitable location to communicate with your snitch?”
