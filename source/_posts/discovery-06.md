Fenton leaned against the conference room’s doorframe as his gaze tracked from Dyrk to Jarvis, “Is everything functioning correctly?” But before either could speak, Fenton ran his hand through his hair, “How about you, Dyrk? Have you been able to secure a source of fuel to keep the reactor running?”

Dyrk’s eyebrow rose, “Nope, but thankfully that’s not my job.”

“Enough,” Jarvis pounded the table with a fist. He took a deep breath and massaged his temples. While his fingers worked, Jarvis closed his eyes. “The two of you need to stop bickering and relax.” With a huff, he leaned back and sucked on his lower lip. He flipped a switch, and the small screen next to him activated. Jarvis flicked through the camera feeds and sighed as the crew tirelessly built the wall. “We’re not about to run out of fuel.”

“That’s only true if those monsters stop assaulting us.”

Jarvis deactivated the monitor and drummed his fingertips across the table. “Fenton, you are correct. If those assaults continue, we’ll deplete our reserves all too quickly.” His fingers continued drumming a march as he took a series of deep breaths. “And thanks to the logs you recovered, we’re aware of all the various creatures that might assault us.”

“All those entries do is detail how we are going to die.”
