With February’s polls complete, I turned my focus to the first story for the month, a Drama. This time instead of heading to NYC Midnight, I turned to a different source for a prompt, a [first line generator](https://writingexercises.co.uk/firstlinegenerator.php). The text message said, very clever… I stared at that line for a while as I let the ideas percolate. Thoughts rushed into my mind but I kept knocking them away. None of those thoughts seemed like a good foundation for a story.<!-- more -->

Then my mind flashed to Law & Order and Perry Mason. Courtrooms have the potential for loads of Drama and my mind began racing. But I needed to work the prompt into the story. And it clicked, have a guy facing a preponderance amount of evidence and a claim as to the words of a text message. From there I let the story unfurl in my mind. Sit down and follow the link to see how this tale unfolds.

A defendant caught with blood on his hands claims someone set him up. Will his attorney be able to shine the light of truth on the crime...
