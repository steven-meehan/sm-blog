When last we visited the recently abandoned crew, Jarvis was doubling down with the colony’s defenses. Every member of the crew takes up the challenge and they’re able to complete the wall and its defenses without major troubles. Despite all the strange creatures that have tried to overrun the settlement, the crew’s determination and passion for survival have kept them alive. However, this strange new world is unwilling to present them with strange new adversaries.<!-- more --> Will the fresh defenses stand against an incoming horde? Or will Jarvis pull a surprise out of his back pocket?

With trembling lips, Jarvis dashed to the nearest station and activated it. “What’s heading for us this time?”

“Would you believe a flying battalion?”

Fenton shouldered Jarvis out of the way and punched the hull. “What did you say?”

“Don’t ask stupid questions, you heard me.”

Jarvis pulled his hand off the terminal and gestured to the closest exit. “Stop antagonizing Dyrk! Grab the best marksman we have.”

Fenton backed toward the hatch and shrugged. “What will they do against flying cavalry?”

“You’ll keep them away from the defensive batteries.”

With a curt nod, Fenton whirled around and leapt through the opening. “On it!”
