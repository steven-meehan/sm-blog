Quinn rested his hands on the conference table, and his eyes traveled from person to person until his gaze fell to Caitlin. “Well, now that Olyver has arrived. I believe we can resume our discussion from yesterday.”

“This day has been a long time coming,” Olyver focused his sneer upon his fellow triumvir as his fingers drummed along his biceps. “But yes, let us formalize this Federation with the colonies we’ve established.”

The bulky man across from Quinn cleared his throat and lifted a finger. “Point of clarification,” He leaned against the table, and it creaked, “Before anyone left this planet, we agreed that none of the new planets would be considered a colony.”

“Quite right, Bartholomew,” Caitlin replied, wringing her fingers while smiling at each of the assembled leaders. “It was a slip of the tongue. I can speak for every triumvir. We never have, nor will we ever consider any of your homes, colonies of this federation. In fact, that’s one of the key points of this meeting.” Caitlin rose and clutched her hands behind her, and started circling the gathered throng. “Before anyone leaves this chamber, we’ll have an agreement to enforce an equal footing in this alliance.”

The woman sitting to Bartholomew’s right turned and gripped Caitlin’s hand. “To achieve that, we’ll require a centralized government that can step in and ensure that each planetary regime plays by the rules.”

“That’s part of the reason we’re gathered here, Kerri.” Caitlin patted the woman’s forearm, gripping it tightly. “Specifically, with this discussion,” Caitlin pulled Kerri’s hand off her wrist and resumed her walk around the table. “With our efforts, the tragic loss of our homeworld will be transformed into a glorious new beginning.”
