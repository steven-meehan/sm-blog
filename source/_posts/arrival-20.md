With backup and all the armaments they can carry, Marcus claims an entire car informing his men to leave him alone until their arrival.<!-- more --> Will Kethra’s preparation spell doom for Marcus and his team?

“Wake up, Marcus! The train’s pulling into the station,” a rumbling voice bellowed.

Marcus rubbed an eyebrow as he pushed himself into a sitting position. He folded his hands in his lap while he stared out the window. “Vincent, have you been out here before?”

“I’m not so foolish as to voluntarily interact with a region full of Kethras.”

Laughter bubbled out of Marcus as he rose and pulled a parcel off the rack. He dropped it into the booth and stretched his sides, “That’s exactly the reason Talia and I avoided this stretch of the railroad. It’s also why I insisted on all of you joining me on this trip.”

“Is our job, simply to be your buffer?”

As the train coasted to a stop, Marcus withdrew his gun, cracked it open, and poured the ammunition into his palm. He scrunched his face and shoved the shells into his pocket and pulled a bullet from a pouch on his waist, and grinned as he slipped it into a chamber. A sorrowful smile formed as he continued to pull rounds from the sack. When he thrust the last one into the handgun, Marcus closed it and returned it to its holster. Marcus’s grin gained some warmth as he touched the pistol, “It’s also the reason I brought all the lizard killer bullets I could get my hands on.”
