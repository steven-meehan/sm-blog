A shot whizzed over Fenton’s head, driving him to the ground. His lips curled into a snarl as his head whipped up, “Why are you firing at friendlies?”

“Sorry about that Fenton, it’s been hectic since you left.”

Fenton climbed to his feet and brushed the dirt off his clothing. He waved his squad on and resumed his jog. “Exactly how hectic was it since we left?”

“Nothing all that glamourous,” Jarvis answered as Fenton’s squad spilled out into the makeshift compound. “But we need to talk.” Without another word, Jarvis spun around and marched up the ramp. “Everyone else needs to join the effort to build the wall around this vessel. Use any materials you can find.”ac

Rubbing his temples vigorously, Fenton followed his commander into the ship. “Why does it feel as if you’re about to drop several bombshells?”

“Because you’re astute.” At the top of the ramp, Jarvis hurried into the chamber and claimed the closest seat. He pulled a tablet off the table, offering it to Fenton, “I believe you mentioned a storage assembly.”
