Silence thundered throughout the stairwell as Maxwell pulled the door open. He hung in the doorway, taking several deep breaths as his eyes flitted about the darkened rooms nearby. Maxwell swallowed a lump as the stillness loomed over him. He released the handle and rubbed the back of his neck as he entered the hallway. “Why would anyone choose to live alone?”

Silence answered Maxwell’s musing as he strolled down the hall. When he approached Darren’s room, Maxwell heard voices creeping out from under Darren’s door. Maxwell licked his lips and inched closer to Darren’s room.

“I need you to come into the city tomorrow night,” a mysterious voice demanded.

Maxwell stopped and examined the empty corridor before pressing his ear against the door.

Laughter died off as Darren replied, “You’ll have to wait a few days. My professors have piled an enormous amount of work onto my plate and they won’t let me leave to support your latest endeavor.”

Thud!
