Darren is falling into a grove with his studies, but his most taxing field is not martial arts with Volodar. Instead, it’s defensive magic, something Darren assumed would be easy. The instructor, Imryll, is a fair yet demanding teacher who wants Darren to stop relying upon his raw physical power.<!-- more --> One day during class, she finds him ignoring the required reading and decides to correct his poor decision. Will he survive the personalized lesson without injury? Or will he suffer for ignoring his instructor’s demands?
