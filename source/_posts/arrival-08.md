Nathaniel urged his horse forward, and while the beast sauntered through the gate, he gawked at Marcus’s ranch. He shook his head as he studied the pristine landscape. He ran his hand through his hair as he cursed his friend’s dedicated spirit. People like Kethra, who didn’t know Marcus grumbled that the farmer usurped resources, but Marcus did not need to. The man devoted himself to cultivate perfection out of every blade of grass.

As Marcus’s home came within view, Nathaniel caught sight of someone working near the house. He drove the horse to a gallop while muttering, “Kethra needs to get over her vendetta.” When he could identify the farmhand, Nathanial pulled on the horse’s reins. “How are you doing, Wayne? Have you seen Marcus?”

“He’s with Talia and Preston in the animal pen,” Wayne replied with a wave.

“Talia is with him?”

“As far as I know,” Wayne responded as he examined two bales of hay. “Did you want to wait in the house for them?”

“No, Kethra is stirring up trouble again.” The leader rubbed his horse’s neck while he stared out towards his friend’s pen. “Can I ride out there? Or do I have to walk?”

“She won’t get past the cattle guard,” Wayne replied without looking away from his work. “You better tie up your horse and hoof it.”
