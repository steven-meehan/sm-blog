“Preston, get over here!” Marcus cried as he spurred his horse towards the fence line. As the horse thundered across the grassland, he glanced back at the herd, catching sight of his helper. Marcus’s eyes whipped around, and he tugged on the reins as his mount drew close to the barrier.

“What’s so important?” Preston asked as he pulled up alongside his boss.

Marcus withdrew his telescope and studied the horizon as he inquired, “How are the newest hands working out?”

Preston leaned forward and patted his horse’s neck. “They seem to be fine,” he replied as he straightened and laid his palms on the pommel. “They’re a little green, like me when I arrived.”

“Are they picking up on their responsibilities?” Marcus asked as he set the telescope across his lap. He turned towards his helper and added, “I know I haven’t paid enough attention to their development as I did with you.”

Preston’s hand gripped his side as his lips quivered.
