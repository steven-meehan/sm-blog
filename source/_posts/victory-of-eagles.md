Temeraire successfully leads multiple assaults against some of the French troops, and the leaders of the regular British military seek to give the leader of the victorious militia a field commission.  Once they discover that they have given Temeraire the commission they slowly and begrudgingly begin to follow Napoleon's example bring the aerial corps indeed into the military rather than using them as an afterthought.

This struggle flows throughout the entire novel, and he has little to lift his spirits as he discovers how hard his nation is being persecuted.
