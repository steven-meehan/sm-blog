I love crafting stories.  It is a transcendent experience for me, to craft tales that people genuinely enjoy reading.  Unfortunately, keeping up the pace I that I want to is not always entirely smooth sailing.  I knew there would be plenty of small expenses to keep this dream alive and I fully embrace them.  But for anyone who has found my site and enjoyed my collection of flash fiction, short stories, reviews, thoughts and musings, I will ask you to consider helping me to keep the lights on and the content coming.<!-- more -->

I have created a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/stevenpmeehan) for precisely this reason.  I have spent a fair amount of time deciding what kind of benefits I would offer for the various levels of support, and as a result of that thought I have come up with the following five tiers.

* ***Copper***: This tier is $2.00 a month and will give the patron access to exclusive flash fiction released on my Patreon page.
* ***Bronze***: This tier is $5.00 a month and will include the reward available to the ***Copper*** tier plus access to drafts of my published novels and short stories.
* ***Silver***: This tier is $25.00 a month and will include the rewards available to the ***Bronze*** tier plus custom swag including.
  * Immediately: A stress reliever
  * After Three months: A coffee mug
  * After Six months: An aluminum water bottle
  * After Nine months: A fleece blanket
  * After Twelve months: A custom hardcover book of eleven of my flash fiction stories, published either on the blog or on Patreon plus a custom one written especially for the patron
  * Every twelve months the patron will receive a signed hardcover copy of any of my published novels, or collected short stories.

  * Immediately: Bi-monthly thirty-minute group phone calls with me via Discord
  * Every six months the patron will receive a signed hardcover copy of any of my published novels, or collected short stories.

  * Six Months: Become an alpha reader for future short stories & novels.
  * Twelve Months: Become a character in upcoming work.

On my [Become A Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/2000997?) page I go into more details for each tier.  So, please visit the page and consider what you can give if you enjoy the content that I create and want to help keep it coming.  One last note for those who love the feel of a hardcover book, the ***Silver***, ***Gold*** and ***Diamond*** tiers will be the best way to get a hardcover copy of my novels and short stories.
