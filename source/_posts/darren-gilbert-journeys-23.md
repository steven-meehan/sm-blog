Darren slammed a book onto the table as the bags under his eyes darkened. “This may be a different subject than Volodar’s required reading.” Darren’s fingers pressed against his temples as his eyelids sagged. “But after a couple nights filled to the brim with obscure texts, it’s all blurring together. Are you hungry?”

“You’re always hungry.”

Darren rubbed the back of his neck as he stared into Lia’s pale blue eyes. “Don’t go twisting my words into a statement that I didn’t make.”

Lia reached out and pinched the peel with her fingertips. Lifting it up, she waggled it in front of Darren’s nose. “This isn’t something I ate.”

“An odd snack means nothing.” Darren snatched the trash and tossed it into a trashcan. As the peal vanished, Darren’s fingers bounced against the table’s edge. 

“Uh-huh.”
