A serialized story is a wonderful thing. With every installment, I’m able to explore the depths of a character that a single novel isn’t capable of achieving. While I have charted a larger story for characters with his abilities, they won’t be the focal point of that narrative. So, with my focus on Micro Fiction, I discovered the perfect opportunity to explore this fantastic collection of characters.<!-- more -->

[Warning](/archives/2021/06/03/wanderings-micro-01) focuses on Ramas Caldwell’s principles. Despite the power forced upon him, Ramas wanders about the continent searching for seclusion. But the common folk know what he is and try to run him off. With dedication and an application of will, Ramas contains the bubbling anger churning within him. Today’s installment highlights who he is when his rigid will softens, even for a moment.

Come, sit down and allow me to give you a mini-escape while I kindle your imagination.

Instantly, the sleepy figure blurred into motion, gripping the length of wood. With a tug, Ramas jumped to his feet while his fingers dug into the soft material, splitting the rod in half. Bits of the wood dripped from each section, like water tumbling off a rock. “Who are you?”

The stranger dropped the remnant and threw his hands up. “I have a message from Nilus Sutton.”
