With the completion of [Bounding Ramps](/archives/2020/03/15/bounding-ramps/) and [Dangerous Cuts](/archives/2020/03/18/dangerous-cuts/), I buckled down and started thinking about the last story of March, a Political Satire. Once more, I focused my attention on the headlines, but this time instead of finding an abundance of articles to pluck a central idea from, all I could find were articles about COVID-19. I didn’t want to write a story about the reaction to the outbreak. But after searching for another option, I couldn’t find something that seemed any better, so I tackled the topic.<!-- more -->

With the central theme selected, I went to NYC Midnight and randomly selected a Political Satire prompt that placed my tale in a Ski Resort and would feature some sushi. It took me a little while, but I was able to shape the reaction I wanted around the location and object. So sit down and dive into Lockdown.

A virus is discovered at a ski resort, while a couple are there on vacation. Will their isolation help them escape the bug’s rampage…

Wanda snagged a California roll with her chopsticks and dipped it into her shallow bowl filled with a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi. She raised the exquisitely formed roll of sushi and pointed it towards her husband. “Do you think this lockdown will end soon?”

Jacob lifted a piece of his own and dunked it into his concoction and took a bite. “I’m uncertain how long the government intends to impose this quarantine.” He dipped the rest into his straight soy sauce and popped it into his mouth. “While the resort is picking up the tab, I’m willing to deal with this lockdown, for as long as it’s required. I haven’t eaten food this delicious for quite a while.”

“But we can’t even go skiing,” Wanda retorted, waving her sushi overhead. “And in case you forgot that was the entire purpose behind this trip.”

Jacob laid his chopsticks down and took a sip of his drink as he flourished his free hand about the room. “They upgraded us to a nicer suite, not to mention they’re providing us with their best food.”

“But how long can they continue feeding us, under this lockdown?”

Jacob rose and walked between the pair of beds, claiming the letter resting upon the shared nightstand.
