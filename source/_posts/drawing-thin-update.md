Whenever I'm finished with my initial work on one of my stories, be it a short story or a full-length novel, I can't wait to get feedback on my work.  This was true for [_Dead Man's Hand_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TTXVQ7A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mysite009e-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TTXVQ7A&linkId=7604bee100b7341d92003d066462a0a6), the flash fiction I post on my blog to the other tales that I've been busy crafting.  So once I finished the initial work on _Drawing Thin_, I immediately started reaching out to people that I trust to give me their honest thoughts on what I had.  In fact, I implored them to tell me where I messed up.  Those particular notes mean more to me than the ones that highlight what they think I did right.<!-- more -->

If my pre-readers were to attempt to spare my feelings, I wouldn't be able to craft a well-rounded story in the end.  With that in mind, I'm always a little nervous once I hand those readers my manuscripts.  Once handed over to those select few, all I can do is wait for them to finish reading the work in question so I can get their opinions and observations.  And as I await those priceless thoughts, I find myself flashing back to my youth as I eagerly wait for Christmas morning to arrive so I can rip into all of the presents that are under the decorated Christmas tree or left in and around my stocking by the fireplace.

I have started to receive feedback from my trusted pre-readers.  And the feedback I've gotten so far has been fantastic, a trend that I expect to continue as I receive the last of my excellent feedback.  With each response, I'm getting a clear picture of what needs to be cleaned up and made sharper.  And so armed with the concerns and criticisms of my pre-readers, I have already started thinking about how I'm going to incorporate their responses into the next revision of _Drawing Thin_.

So as I'm entering the final phase of this book's journey to publication, I've realized just how much work will be required so I know that I will have to push back my target publication date by a few months.  However, I'm still eager to bring this tale to the world and continue the story I began with [_Dead Man's Hand_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TTXVQ7A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mysite009e-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TTXVQ7A&linkId=7604bee100b7341d92003d066462a0a6).

So keep an eye here on the blog, for more updates on _Drawing Thin_'s journey to publication, including sample chapters.  These will be published once I'm finished making all of the changes from my pre-readers.
