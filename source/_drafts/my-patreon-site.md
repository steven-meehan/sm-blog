I love writting stories.  It is an absolutely wonderful experience, to craft tales for people to read.  Unfortunately keeping up the pace I have become accustomed to is not always entirely smooth sailing.  I knew there would be plenty of small expenses to keep this dream alive and I fully embrace them.  But for anyone who has found my site and enjoyed my flash fiction, short stories, reviews, thoughts and musings, I will ask for your help to keep the lights on and the content coming.<!-- more -->

I have created a Patreon page for exactly this reason.  I spent some time deciding what teirs I would offer for this venture and I came up with the following five teirs:

* ***Copper***: This tier is $2.00 a month and will help me keep the lights on and the content flowing.
* ***Bronze***: This tier is $5.00 a month and give the patron access to exclusive flash fiction released on my patreon page.
* ***Silver***: This tier is $18.50 a month and will include the reward available to the ***Bronze*** tier plus custom swag including.
  * Immeadiately: A stress reliever
  * After Three months: A coffee mug
  * After Six months: An alluminum water bottle
  * After Nine months: A fleece blanket
  * After Twelve months: A custom hard cover book of eleven of my flash fiction stories, published either on the blog or on patreon plus a custom one written especially for the patron
  * Every twelve months the patron will receive a signed hard cover copy of any of my published novels, or collected short stories.
