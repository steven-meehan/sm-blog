Fairy Tale	A noodle shop	Mittens

One day a father and his daughter were out eating at their favorite restaurant.  They were at The Noodle Shop, the father enjoyed that he got the night off from cooking, while his daughter enjoyed her macaroni and cheese.  Every time they went, there would get their meal and then go to their regular booth and enjoy their dinner together.  This night, however, their night was about to change.

A small man, who was walking stiffly trying not to spill his food, approaching their booth.  Without asking the man sat down next to the father saying, "I hate to interrupt, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation and unfortunately for you sir she is correct unicorns do exist.<!-- more -->"

The father looked down his shoulder at spoke firmly, "You shouldn't barge into someone's table like that."

The stranger ignored the rebuke and spoke to the little girl, "Not only do they exist but so do numerous other creatures."

The father looked at his daughter and saw that she was becoming mesmerized by this stranger's words.   So he elbowed the stranger commanding, "Leave us alone we're trying to enjoy our time."

The stranger grunted standing up from the booth.  After retrieving his meal, he spun around and left muttering something under his breath.

The father watched the interloper left as he turned his head around and spoke to his daughter.  "I'm sorry about darling."

"No worries, dad."  The little girl replied as she watched the man disappear around a corner of the restaurant.

The father smiled at his daughter as he felt the air around them grow thicker, prompting him to look up from his little girl.  Then he saw the interior of The Noodle Shop begin to grow and expand.  He shook his head with shock as he saw the windows as they faded from view.  As the proportions stretched out, he looked down and saw the fear creeping up on his daughters face.

As the daughter's fear began to rise she looked at her father and shadowed being grabbed him whisking him away right before her eyes.  She leaped from the booth trying to grab hold of her father, but her fingers just missed her father falling upon the floor that had begun to sprout grass.

She lay there crying when something began nuzzling at her head.  She whipped her head up hoping to see her father but instead saw the muzzle of a unicorn.  If her father were with her, she would have squealed with joy, but instead, she dropped her head muttering, "My father was taken."

"I know little one," The unicorn replied with an angelic voice.

Sniffling, the little girl, looked up, "Do you know where he is?"

"I do child, and the wizard will not easily relinquish what he has taken."

"Can you help me?"  The little girl pleaded as she slowly began to stand.

The unicorn shook her head answering, "I will not be able to help you on my own child."  With those words, tears began to well up around the girl's eyes.  And the unicorn looked down offering, "Though I do have friend's that might be able to help us rescue your father.  Come climb on my back and hold around my neck tightly."

The little child followed those directions, and the unicorn began to speed through the partially transformed restaurant.  They passed by numerous tables and booths as they sought the unicorn's friends.  They collected a wise and fierce wolf, a silent and noble stag and a bold and stoic bear.

Each consented to try and help the child rescue her father and the party quickly made its way to the wizard's sacred grove.  It was located in the heart of the endlessly forested Noodle Shop, the kitchen.  Towards, what should be the center of the kitchen the tile there seemed to have been partially transformed into sand.  She saw her father tied to a steel beam inside of a circle of stones and small pots.

Those shadowed figures and the stranger, who had interrupted their meal, were circling her father.  The man was no longer dressed in the baggy clothes, and she could see what he and his shadowy friends were.  Pulling from her mythology these creatures before her were satyrs.  She whispered to the unicorn, "What are they doing?"

"They are preparing the ritual to transfer your father's essence to the wizard."  The wolf answered for the unicorn.

"How can we save him?"  Asked the frightened child.

"We can fight off the satyrs, but the wizard will stay to try and complete his ritual.  You need to disrupt his circle if you do that he will be dispersed."  The bear said with his lyrical voice.

"Get down from my back, and I will do my best to keep whatever magic the wizard can do away from you.  We will follow your lead in this child."  The unicorn said kindly.

The child climbed down from the creature's back and without thinking she ran towards the circle.  Her newfound friends true to their word forced the shadowed satyrs away while the unicorn did what she could to shield the child.  Her fingers found an exposed handle of one of the pots.  Wrapping her fingers around it, she began to pull with all her might.  Yet somehow it wouldn't budge.  Reaching down into herself she found the strength she didn't know she had and pulled.

And as the Satyr was lunching for her, the pot gave way, and she flew back into the sandy tiles.  Then light washed over everything, and a great boom filled the world as the daughter fell into unconsciousness.

When she woke up, she was sitting in the booth with her father and on her lap were a pair of mittens.  They had images of the unicorn and her friends that helped her.  She picked up the angelically soft pale blue mittens as she looked up at her smiling father and knew that everything would be alright.
