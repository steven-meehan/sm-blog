Quinn tapped his desk and looked over the proposal. When he finished pursuing the document, he dropped the pad and groaned. He glared at Olyver and took a lengthy breath. “Caitlin, is there any reason you’ve abandoned the plan we originally detailed?”
Caitlin nodded as she picked up the device. “There are four additional colonies to be established in this system.”
“And we don’t have the resources to do that all at once,” Quinn rebuked, slamming his hand down to punctuate his words.
Olyver’s lips curled into a mocking grin. He folded his hands behind his back and tilted his head. “The supporting documentation about the population are included in the pad. Didn’t you read through those sections?”
With a growl, Quinn lifted the device. “Yes, Olyver, I scanned the entire report.” He tossed it at the triumvir and continued. “But as usual you’re shortsighted. If we press on with our colonization efforts, before each colony has established itself the colonies will fail.”
“That’s not entirely true,” Caitlin replied. She sauntered next to Quinn and kneeled, taking his hand in hers. She withdrew another pad and placed it into his. “Don’t forget that Aurora was a world ship.”
