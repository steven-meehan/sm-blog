I remember almost five years ago I bought a computer game called [Torchlight](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085P7YGU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mysite009e-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0085P7YGU&linkId=235131b07ffde76feb3b808a08e7fd4e) from Amazon.  A friend had recommended the game, and I decided it was time to give it a try, so I started a game.  Well as I was playing with the game with my first character, an idea for a story popped into my mind.  It took some time for me to craft that initial thought into a proper storyline, even longer to decide how to tell the tale of Harrison & Sylvia.  I ultimately decided that a collection of short stories would be a fantastic way to tell it.<!-- more -->

Off and on over the last five years, I have been working on these stories, and now five years after the initial concept I am close to being done with them.  The stories are currently getting a once-over from a few people so I can have the best stories that I can possibly have.  Once the stories are done the next step will be publishing them, and I already know how I'm going to release them.  I am going to release them to my site throughout next year, one every month.

When I go to publish one of these short stories I will post a News article linking to it.  The article will include the story's accompanying image and a brief blurb letting people know what to expect.  I am striving to keep to my deadline with these short stories which would mean that the first installment of [Harrison & Sylvia](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01) should be ready for posting this coming January.
