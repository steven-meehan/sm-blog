Having enjoyed Larry Correiaâ€™s first story featuring Tom Stranger, I decided to pick up the next entry in the series, A Murder of Manatees. Having read through the first story, I eagerly let the latest adventure of my favorite Interdimensional Insurance Agent play out. Of course the humor of the previous installment, is in full force in this aquatic investigation, and it starts out with Tom Stranger leading a convention about the audio recording of his first adventure.

From the first tale, We are introduced to two different Larry Correias. The first is the writer, who later "publishes" an audio book of Tom Stranger's activities.<!-- more --> The other is known as the Interdimensional Lord of Hate, and he's the richest man in all the multiverse. Unfortunately, for the author Larry Corriea, his story didn't live up to Tom Stranger's expectations, and during the conference, it becomes obvious that Tom does not understand the intricacies of Larry Corriea's (the author) world.

After the conference, Tom Stranger roles into his junior associates' reviews. As he plows through them, he comes to the one he'd been dreading, Jimmy the intern. While the events of the previous story impressed Tom enough to give Jimmy a chance, the lad proves unable to live up to the expectations of an Interdimensional Insurance Agent/Intern. One of the highlights of Jimmy's ineptitude is when he tries to sell insurance to a potential client, a head of cabbage.

As before, Jimmy is the primary source of the book's humor, and it's perfectly delivered. The story quickly splits into two different narratives, one following Jimmy's journey and the other following Tom's investigation of Wendell the Manatee's kidnapping. Pull of a comfortable chair and pick up the latest entry in the adventures of The Adventures of Tom Stranger, Interdimensional Insurance Agent.
