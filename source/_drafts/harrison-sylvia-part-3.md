Having achieved his lifelong dream of replicating a relic Harrison is ecstatic.  Yet as he names his device, the Illuminator, his father dashes his hopes of aimlessly tinkering with relics when he informs his son that his Illuminator is going to be mass produced.  And adding insult to injury, his father demands that Harrison replicate their other relics for the same purpose.  

Hunger for the prestige his son has managed to gain, Harrison's father uses the influence he has to give his son more relics to study.  And for the first time, he begins to understand just how deliberate his father is, no matter how callous it might make him.

After exhausting the relics on his family's isle, Harrison is forced to refine his Illuminator for other purposes, while his father arranges a trip to the King's Isle.  As the scribe is organizing meetings with some of the more prominent nobleman living on the King's Isle, Harrison is hard at work crafting new designs for his Illuminator.  

When Harrison finally arrives on the King's Isle, will he be able to replicate another relic?  Come and discover if he is able to satisfy his father's hunger for power and prestige.
