Leland Roxley centers around him and he is bringing the truck in to the dump his partner Veit Frostbeard hops off and and Eva Weaver appears in the cab of his truck  he yelps in surprise and she asks, when are you going to make your wishes she teases him with powers (mage), he refuses wealth (makes diamonds, saphires, emeralds and gold appear) even offers him the most succulent meal she asks what he likes but she smiles and answers for him and makes a succulent porkchop appear she insists that he trya small bite he does and tells her he's not interested in making wishes she scowls and her lithe features melt away and reveal the bulbous and hideous features of her race a slapp on the side of the truck causes him to flinch and open the door to see his partner the stout dwarf growls and tells him to open the bed so they can do their work
