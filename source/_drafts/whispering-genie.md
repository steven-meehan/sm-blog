As the truck slowed to a stop, Leland took it out of gear and tapped his partner's shoulder. "Veit, we're back. Go on and start emptying the truck."
"I did it last time, Leland," Veit complained.
Leland scoffed as he looked at his diminutive partner, "It's not my fault you can’t drive the truck."
"That's not fair," Veit grumbled as he yanked his door open. "You'll have to take a turn doing this work eventually."
"No, I won't," Leland replied as he threw the lever to open the garbage truck for Veit. "Come grab me when once the back is emptied."
Veit dropped to the ground and slammed his door shut. Leland grinned at the usual banter and leaned his head against the headrest. "You do know that you don't have to continue working with that foul Dwarf."
"Go away, Eva," Leland snarled. "I've told you before I don't want anything to do with you."
She lifted one of his eyelids and stared into his now open eye. Leland studied the woman before him, and muttered, "At least this time you didn't alter your appearance."
Eva smiled and pushed him into the door, "You know the only way you can get rid of me, Leland Roxley."
Groaning Leland sat up and turned towards the passenger seat and saw the pale skinned woman. Her silver hair cascaded down around her face accentuating the slitted pupils of her yellow-green eyes. Leland tore his eyes away from her face and ignored the skintight body suit that clothed her. "I've told you that I'm not going to make a wish, and I know the rules."
"They're not really rules," Eva said as she looked out of the windshield. "They're more like guidelines, Leland."
"Not going to happen," Leland replied as he leaned his head back against the headrest.
"I could give you eternal youth," Eva whispered into his ear with a sultry and seductive voice.
A shudder of intense pleasure ran through Leland with those words. But he shoved the sensation out of his mind and with a breaking voice whispered, "No, thanks."
Eva laughed a deep belly laugh at his objection. "I know that's not true."
"Not interested," Leland muttered with a steadier voice.
Eva leaned closer to his ear and whispered, "I know that's not true, Leland Roxley." She reached out and caressed his chin with the back of her hand. "All you have to do is ask for it."
"Not interested," Leland replied with more conviction.
"I know that's not true," Eva said. She leaned in and kissed his temple and added, "But I won't pursue that wish at the moment. How about the power of mage? I know you've dreamt of that since your childhood."
Leland swallowed and stuttered, "No... Not interested."
"You could have the power to take your rightful place in your family," Eva said as she grabbed one of his hands.
"No," Leland replied as he tried to pull his hand out of her grasp.
"Power like this," She whispered as she coursed power into his hand. "Can you feel the power?"
"Not interested in it," Leland said as he looked at her sprawled out across his body. He shoved the energy crackling around his hand back into her and snarled, "You’ve been trying this for weeks. Ever since my family realized that I wasn't dead."
"They want what's best for you," Eva replied.
"No, they want to drag me into something I don't want anything to do with." Leland pulled her lithe body off him and shoved her back to the door. "I don't want any wishes."
Eva looked over her shoulder with a sultry expression, "No one has ever refused me."
A hand slapped his door, and Veit bellowed, "Alright, Leland, it's time for you to get out of the truck and help out."
Leland opened the armrest and withdrew his mask. He slipped the mask over his mouth, saying, "I have work to do, Eva, now go away."
When Leland opened his door, he heard a whisper, "You will make your wishes."
Hoping down Leland followed Veit to the back of the garbage truck and grabbed the hose. Looking into the now empty cavity, Leland reeled back, "What was in there today?"
"You have no business complaining," Veit muttered as he helped Leland get the hose into position. "You didn't have to deal with it full."
"True enough," Leland muttered as he activated the hose. Cleansing liquid flew towards the inside of the truck and turned to foam on impact. Leland used discreet motions to coat the entirety of the garbage truck with the cleansing foam. He turned the hose off and returned it, he returned to the cab and pulled the lever to close the back of the truck.
Looking back to Veit, he said, "I'm off, I'll see you in the locker room."
"Later, Leland," Veit said as he stalked off to the locker room to get cleaned.
When the door closed, Eva asked, "Why do you work this job?"
"Because I don't want to return to the family," Leland quipped. "I will not sell my integrity."
"You don't have to go back to your family," Eva said as Leland parked the truck into its spot for the day. "You could claim what you want and then be able to fight them off when they come for you."
Leland opened his door and stared at Eva, "I won't make wishes with a genie, Eva. Besides, I know your guidelines as well."
Eva glared at Leland, "What does that mean?"
"That I'm not going to collapse when you're about to vanish," Leland said.
"There's only one way to be free of me!" Eva shouted.
"Not true," Leland said as he slammed his door. As Eva followed him, Leland stopped, "You can only stay here if I made a wish. But since I haven't," Leland looked down at his watch and then started to wave as Eva vanished. "And your time is up."
