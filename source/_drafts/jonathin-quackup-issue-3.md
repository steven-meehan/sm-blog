It was time to pull out [Jonathin Quackup, Issue 3](https://www.comixcentral.com/products/jonathin-quackup-of-the-planet-weralt-3/) out and read the book that alerted me to the series.  After reading the first two issues, I was excited about reading this issue of the comic book.  So I found a nice quiet place and opened up the book and began thumbing through the digital pages soaking in all the artwork.  Just like before the artwork was crisp and clean and gave me a rough idea of the story without reading the text.

The first page delves into a brief overview of what happened during the previous two books.  And continues straight into the piece of the story it is dedicated to, Jonathin's travel into the north.<!-- more --><span class="embedded-image-left">![](./jonathin-quackup-issue-3.jpg)</span>  The art does a fantastic job to present a long an arduous travel in a concise number of frames.  It also helps to show that passion that drives our hero.  As before there is a page that truly captures my eye and keeps me coming back.  Unlike before this page is a wonderful example of less is more.  Unfortunately, this page is the last page of the issue, so I won't go into too many details.  That said it is a wonderful use of imagery and text.

Once I finished taking in the art, held within this tome, I turned my attention to its text.  Now at this point, I should mention that issue three was the shortest, yet it managed to give the most insight into our main character.  We are given an insight into Jonathin's sheer determination to find his answers and the power of his conviction.  Then once he has climbed into the mountains entering a truly frigid environment, we see his ingenuity to be able to stay warm, while he got a night's sleep.

But his sleep was not a good one, we are introduced to his dreams, and from the text, it seems like its always the same one.  We are introduced to a particular moment in his youth.  There are plenty of people in the dream bit aside from Jonathin's face we are only able to see one.  And based upon the text it appears to be a father, or merely a father figure, who leaves him to deal with a commotion.  Of course, before we are able to delve any further into the memory, Jonathin wakes to find snow falling.

The story is well crafted and has captured my attention.  I cannot wait for the next installment of this series to find out what will happen next.  I will keep an eye out for the next issue on the author's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/myalarmclock/) and his [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/raytoons/created).  Until then I will periodically thumb through these tomes and enjoy the journey I have access to.
