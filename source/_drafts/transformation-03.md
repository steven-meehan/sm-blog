(Conflict is the debate between the three triumvirs about what they are doing and what they should be doing ends with a resolution to alter the plans slightly to each gain something they want
Quinn - An increase in military might
Caitlain - A continued increase in the sciences and dedication to the improvement of the platforms
Malark Rein (Third Triumvire) - A commitment to the equality of the federation planets and a focus on new and improved colonization away from the massive colonization ships and a move towards ships that will colonize single worlds by forming the central city of the colonization)
 
Caitlin, Quinn, and Malark arrange the creation and development of the new capital.  It takes most of five years but they establish a thriving city and build the infrastrucure of the planet.  A meeting of the Triumvis to discuss the next phase of the plan their expansion and how the new federation will be structured.  They each raise points that have been raised by the people, But Quinn insists that ships must be a central part of the federation so as not to allow the platforms to wipe out the entirety of their new federation, Caitlain agrees and insists that the new platforms need to be an intracate web of connectins rather than a spoke style that Laria clung to they all agree and she mentions that the test platforms are workign to allow travel between the new cities Quinn accepts the advance and the third triumvir nods stating that the people are insistant that each planet be equal despite Aurora be the capital of the federation, each planet needs to feel that it's opinion is valid and that the new desgins for colonization ships are well underway and should be ready for departure in ten short years
