"Where is he?" Caitlain asked as she stared at the empty seat.

Looking up from his papers, Quinn shook his head as he smiled and answered.  "Malark knows how much his tardiness annoys you.  Why do you think he's constantly late?"

"Is it too much to ask for a little decorum from him?"

"No, but at the same time if you just left it alone he would stop wasting our time."

Caitlain took a step towards the seated man when the door to the room opened.  She looked over her shoulder and spotted the heavy set individual as he waddled into the room.  With a huff 

Caitlain stalked to her desk as the new arrival slowly approached his own.  "I do apologize for being late.  But I was in a meeting with a number of concerned citizens."

With a sigh, Caitlain shook her head and spoke with a tempered tone.  "Malark, it is still far too early to be discussing the eventual workings of the new federation."

"And why is that my dear?  It's been five years since the two of you founded this triumvirate.  And we are no closer to having that question answered.  And there are more worried about that than you want to admit to."  Malark replied smoothly as he moved the strain from his legs to the masterfully carved chair behind his desk.

â€œMalark," Quinn began as he shuffled papers around on his desk.  "We have more pressing concerns than the shape of a government that is fifteen to twenty years away."

"We disagree on that, Quinn."

"Who is we?" Caitlain asked as she pulled some scrap paper to her.

"Enough of the population that we can alter the makeup of this triumvirate if we need to." Malark replied with a hint of a threat to his words.

Quinn glanced a look over to Caitlain and made an imperceptible shake of his head, silencing the objection that leapt to her mouth.  When she settled back into her seat Quinn, asked "And what exactly do you all want to discuss?"

"We feel that a discussion about the new colonization ships needs to be approved and that the guidelines for the equality of planets needs to be established as law now rather than continue to slide as it did back on Laria."

Caitlain slammed her hands upon her desk, "You know full well that every planet was considered equal under the law."

"Maybe," Malark said slowly. "It was for some, Caitlain.  But the silent majority found no equality in the law."

"And as such you want to be able to ensure your people that there will be such a law."  Quinn said as he nodded his head.

"Yes."

"You do realize that we will have to manufacture more warships to be able to protect those smaller colonization ships."  Quinn replied as he tapped a scrap of paper in front of him.

"We are aware of that," Malark said with a sly smile.  Lifting a finger he spoke to the military minded Triumvir.  "And for that purpose alone my group is more than willing to back you with an increased attention to the formation of the military."

Caitlain's eyes bulged as she listened to Malark's bald faced bribery.  But Quinn raised his hand to silence her argument.  "It would also require backing the work of the scientists to perfect the platforms."

"Those things are already working."  Malark replied as he leaned back into his chair.

"They are not already working." Caitlain replied as she focused her narrowed eyes upon Malark's bulk.

"Platforms of the new design are already setup across the new cities." Malark said as he raised an eyebrow at Caitlain's objection.

But Quinn prevented her from raising too much of an objection.  "Just because they work on a planet does not mean they will work across the vastness of space."

"They will."

"But more resources need to be given there, to ensure that we are able to do it."  Quinn replied with an even tone.

With a brusk nod, "Fine then if we can agree to start the deliberations on the new colonization ship designs and the equality of planets then I will agree to both of your proposals."

"Fine," Quinn replied with a slight nod of his head.

"Excellent!" Malark cried out as he slammed his pudgy fingers together.  With a groan the triumvir clambered to his feet and made his way out of the shared office.  "I need to talk with my constituents."

"Certainly," Quinn said as Caitlain stared at him with outrage burning behind her eyes.

Once the triumvir was long gone from the office, she leaped to her feet and demanded, "Why did you agree to all of that?!"

"Because we didn't have to give up all that much and we will secure what we need without appearing to take control of government."  Quinn replied as he leaned back into his chair and stared into the ceiling.  After a moment's silence he muttered, "I just wonder why he was so insistent to have the conversations."

"Does it matter?!"

"Caitlain, all we promised was to have those conversations."  She wanted to scream in frustration but Quinn silenced her with a finger.  "All we promised was to have the conversations.  He promised to allow our initiatives to expand."

Caitlain laughed and smiled, "I guess I need to start taking your advice."
