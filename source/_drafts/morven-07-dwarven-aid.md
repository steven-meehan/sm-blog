Caleb stopped walking and leaned against the closest tree so he could do a quick check of his weapons.  He thought about where he was, he had been trying to follow the path his team had taken during the last hunt.  Based on the terrain Caleb wasn't sure how much luck he was going to have, too much of the world looked the same.  With a sigh, he holstered all of his weapons and lifted his rifle up and resumed his search.

He rubbed his eyes as he forced himself to keep putting one foot in front of the other.  He needed to locate the dwarves, without their aid the settlement would be overrun.  But he'd been searching for almost an entire day with absolutely no luck in finding the dwarves.<!-- more -->  But he knew that he was going to have to start looking for a place where he would be able to secure for a few hours of sleep.  And of course, when he made that decision, he caught sight of some tracks.  With a groan, Caleb pushed his exhaustion aside and started following the tracks.

As he followed the scarce tracks, he was careful not to announce himself to anyone who might be trying to follow him.  But with each step, his mind was busy trying to figure out what he was going to say if he managed to locate the dwarves.  He had only met a handful of them the last time, and Fitik had pretty much said don't call us we'll call you.  Despite that Caleb was hoping that the sheer mass of trolls and goblins would inspire these stout warriors to their aid.  

After following the tracks for close to an hour, Caleb wasn't sure if the dwarves could move that fast or if they were just that far ahead of him.  His exhaustion was once again threatening to overtake him.  He reached into his vest and grabbed a bottle fishing two capsules out of it.  He really hated taking these things, but he needed to stay awake just a little bit longer.  He could sleep once the settlement was defended.  After forcing the pills down his throat, he managed to catch sight of something in front of him.

Caleb pulled his rifle into his shoulder and looked down the sights.  He wanted to be safe just in case whatever had caused that motion was something more unfriendly.  Caleb steadied himself preparing for whatever would come his way and called out to the moving shadows.  They instantly spun and circled back surrounding him.  Caleb swallowed the nervous lump that formed in his throat and lowered his rifle.  He looked through the eyes staring back at him and was thankful to find Fitik's eyes staring into his own.  Caleb's eyes lit up and shone with joy as he called out, "Fitik, you have no idea how glad I am to see you."

"What do you want, Caleb?"

"We need your help," Caleb responded before Fitik could finish the question.

Fitik sighed and looked away before saying, "We told you we would have to think about it, Caleb."

"There is an army of trolls, goblins and other creatures massing near our walls."

"Massing?" A skecptical dwarf asked.

Caleb tried to latch his eyes upon the dwarf who asked the question but he wasnt able to find the inquisative dwarf.  So he spoke in a voice that all could hear.  "There are so many of these creatures swarming up that the ground seems to be writhing where they stand."

At that news Fitik's eyes went wide and murmuring began to echo around Caleb.  He wasnt able to pick out much of the conversations occuring around him but he was able to isolate the hatred they had for the trolls and goblins.  He returned his eyes back to Fitik and noticed the dwarf was deep in thought as his fingers ran through his thick beard.  It took a few minutes longer but Fitik looked up and Caleb knew that he had made up his mind.

"So Fitik, what's the news?"  Caleb asked slightly afraid of what the dwarf's reply would be.

Fitik looked around at his fellow dwarves and saw their reactions, but he had already made up his mind and Caleb knew that where he went the others would follow.  The dwarf walked closer to Caleb and offered the man his hand as he said, "Well it seems that we have friends that we need to help."

Caleb smiled as he took the dwarf's hand and pumped it vigorusly.  "Thank you Fitik."

"Thank you for inviting us to a cleansing of troll filth, but we'll have to go gather the rest of the clan."  Fitik replied through a smile.

"Do you wnat me to wait here?"

"We wouldnt force a friend to wait in the middle of nowhere while we got the rest of the clan."  Fitik said as he pulled Caleb deeper into the forest.
