Tarian and his closet advisors were standing on the wall looking out at the massing horde of alien creatures.  With the use of a telescope, he was able to identify more of the trolls, goblins and even some new creatures that looked just as terrifying.  When he lowered the scope from his eye, he looked over his shoulder and spoke to Keldon, but loudly enough for the others to hear his concern.  "Kel, there are already more out there than the last time we had to defend the wall."

Keldon reached out, and Tarian handed the scope over to his friend who looked out over the massing force.<!-- more -->  "There are new creatures out there in that mass."

"I saw that," Tarian said grimly.

"We were barely able to hold the last time they assaulted us," Sherry said as her head buried into her hands.

"What about our new friends?"  Caleb asked, his voice still managing to cling to some hope.

"The Dwarves might help us," Tarian said flatly.

"It would be nice to have a little more help," Keldon said quickly.

Tarian turned around to look at those gathered around him, "And that's your job Kel.  We will cause a distraction in their ranks, and you will go find the Elves."

"I still say that's a terrible name," Keldon said evenly.  "But I'll do it."

"And Caleb I want you to go find the Dwarves to get their assistance in repelling this threat."

Caleb nodded saying, "I'll go prep my team..."

"No," Tarian said with a voice as unyielding as steel.

"We're not going to take or teams?"  Keldon asked fearing he knew the answer."

"No, we can't afford it, everybody along the wall will matter."  He looked at Keldon then to Caleb.  "Take any gear you can carry and that you think you might need.  But you each go alone."

"I don't like it Tarian," Keldon said with a groan.

"I don't either, Kel, but we can't afford to lose anybody from the defense of the wall," Tarian said through a sigh.

"Yeah, I get it Tarian."  Keldon handed the telescope over to his friend then he clapped Caleb on the back.  "Looks like we get the don't screw it up mission."

"At least the Dwarves are friendly towards us,"  Caleb said with a subdued grin.

Keldon shrugged his shoulders saying, "I enjoy a challenge."

"Go, the rest of us will provide you with a distraction."  When Keldon and Caleb were gone Tarian lifted his head and finished the thought that was running through his mind.  "Maybe what we do will thin them out enough for us to survive without the help from those races."

"You needed..." Sherry began, but she was silenced with a wave of Tarian's hand.

"I know.  Do we have enough explosives left to vaporize the center of that mass?"  Tarian asked with a slight ember of hope in his chest.

One of the other men took a step closer to the wall and pulled the telescope from Tarian's grasp and answered.  "I don't think we have enough to wipe out that much of their center.  But we should be able to scrape enough to make them back off a little bit."

"How quickly can we get that pulled together?"  Tarian asked Lloyd as he rubbed at his temples.

"Give us three hours, and we will be able to replicate the experience for them," Lloyd answered pulling the telescope from his eye.

"And if we gave you an hour?"  Tarian asked grimly.

"Then we wouldn't be able to replicate the experience," Lloyd answered with finality.

"Then you have those three hours, I have a feeling we'll need more than a single flash in a pan to survive this."

Lloyd handed Tarian the telescope, "On it Tarian."  Llyod raced to arrange for the destruction for Caleb and Keldon.

Tarian put his hands upon the top of the wall and looked into the maw of the massing army.  The silence began to grow exponentially until he spoke without turning around.  "Sherry start drawing up defense plans.  Take what we learned from the last assault and use it to make sure we hold the wall."

"Yes, sir," Sherry said corralling the rest of the people to help her arrange the wall's defense.  Tarian watched the undulating mass without the help from the telescope with a sense of awe.  When they first arrived in orbit there had not been this much life on the surface.  There had been some but not anywhere near this much.  He stood there trying to figure things out when someone tapped his shoulder.

"Yes," Tarian said emotionlessly.

"We are ready to launch the missile."

"We had a missile shell, Lloyd?"  Tarian asked with awe cracking into his question.

"We had the materials to craft a few missiles, Tarian."

"Well, by all means, fire the first missile," Tarian replied through a fledgling smile.

Lloyd nodded and pulled his radio out issuing an order, "Send Keldon and Caleb out once the missile has detonated."  The confirmation came immediately, and the missile launched and rocketed through the sky.  Tarian looked through the telescope and watched as the wriggling mass of creatures detonated and a massive swath of the army was removed from the battlefield.

Putting the telescope down on the wall Tarian turned to look at Lloyd, "Hopefully that will give Caleb and Kel the space they need to get help.”

“If it doesn’t?”  Lloyd asked with a serious expression.
Tarian sighed having thought about it himself, “Then hopefully that missile and the two you have in reserve will help us survive the assault."
