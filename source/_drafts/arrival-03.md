Marcus was leaving yet another meeting of the leadership, when he ran into Talia, "Do you think we'll ever be able to start trying to survive?" 
"Well we've been able to get the animals to start breeding, which is a good thing." 
Marcus stopped as he suddenly realized something, "How were we able to get them out of storage?" 
"We didn’t get them all." 
"I thought we did." 
Shaking her head Talia replied, "No, once the ship stopped moving, we started getting the animals out but we were only about a quarter of the way through the storage tanks when the storage system died." 
"That doesn’t mesh with what I heard."
"What did you hear?"
"I remember hearing ten percent of the animals survived." 
"Ah, that explains it."
"Explains what?"
She resumed walking as she answered, "Ten percent is the right number, after you include all the animals that weren’t in storage."
"Right the lose one."
"Yup people seem to need the fresh food and supplies on these colonization trips." 
"Fair enough." Marcus replied as he nodded his agreement
"Which division are you being assigned to?" Tara asked as they meandered around the area
"I'm not smart enough to rate the central region."
"You're no dummy Marcus."
"Which is why I forced myself to the Eastern region."
"You want to be a farmer?"
"I've done it in the past and more to the point it's something that I can handle."
"You were a colonizer?"
As a smile spread across his lips, "I was going to be a colonizer, but Nathaniel managed to see how I kept longingly look up to the ship.  And he eventually asked me if I wanted to join the ship's crew."
"That simple?"
"No it wasn't that simple.  Just before the colonization ship was supposed to leave Nathaniel came and spoke to me and it was a long conversation, but at the end he had talked me into abandoning my nearly finished plot of land and joining his crew."
"So you aren't a mindless drone."
Leaning into her he whispered, "I don’t think you'll want to describe any of us like that."
"Fair enough, but my point still stands."
"Yes, I was a colonist once upon a time."
"How long did it take you to master your new responsibilities?"
"Not all that long." Marcus replied as they continued on, "Are you going to be going to the Eastern region?"
"Yeah, I will be." Talia
"Are we going to have enough animals to support the proposed five regions?" Marcus
With a laugh that didn’t reach her lips, "No, the western region doesn’t have nearly enough to support everyone." Talia
"So that means that the northern region will be responsible for discovering everything about the local wildlife." Marcus
"Yeah, while the southern region delves into the local ocean life for food and water generation." Talia replied
"Every group will have a job, Talia."
"Do you think the scientists will be able to figure out a way for us to get off this rock?"
Marcus bent down and lifted a partially buried stone as he replied, "I'm not sure Talia.  I mean we barely entered the planet's orbit when every electrical based piece of technology failed."  He began to gently toss the stone up into the air as he answered, "It wasn’t a gradual process, like it was for the storage facility, so I don't know."
"I wonder why we were able to use the storage facility for a little while."
Marcus threw the stone off into the distance as he answered, "I don’t know the science behind the storage technology, but what I do know is that it is fundamentally different than the rest of our technology."
"Wait? What?"
"I don’t get it but then again I'm not supposed to."
Talia looked around and realized they were very much alone, despite being in the basic campsite.  She cleared her throat and asked, "Marcus, we might be stuck here for our lifetimes and I don’t want to be randomly assigned to anyone."
As she went silent trying to figure out the best way to ask the question, he came to her rescue. "I'd like that Talia, thank you for asking."
"I guess we need to let the brass know about it."
"Yeah, we'll have to get that taken care of but for the moment it doesn’t matter." Marcus said as he pulled her into his arms
