dystopian sci-fi    ship    whisk

small team of elite marines for the remnants of the world's human population is busy clearing out the a ship that a scouting team found that appears to be seaworthy

They have cleared out the majority of the ship and are down to exploring the galley when three of the marines enter the room the lead marine catches sight of movement he pulls his rifle to his shoulder and tracks the motion before squeezing the trigger

a bolt of pale blue light steaks through the room illuminating the room letting all three men see the hoard of creatures standing in the galley, the bolt lanced the creature that moved but the lead marine could hear the motions of the rest of the creatures moving and took enough steps back as he cried light up the doorway

the other two marines joined him in unleashing a torrent of pale blue lights flying from their barrels into the lumbering creatures as the approached door when one marine's weapon ran dry they would remove the power pack from the rifle and effortlessly added another they kept pulling the trigger untill each was down to their last power cell

the leader tossed in a ligting sphere, illuminating the entire galley and as the leader began to scan the room he saw a hand fall upon something that launched somethign into the air spinning towards the team leader and it landed right in front of him 

one of the other marines asked what was it and the leader picked it up in one hand after he saw that the creatures were dead it was a whisk came the response

the team leader radioed to hte men waiting for the all clear as he said, we have cleanup but we are all clear for our ride out of here
