dystopian sci-fi    ship    whisk

The team led by Ray was the last team still searching the seemingly abandoned battleship.  The relatively small force of humanity on the shore was eagerly awaiting an all-clear from each inspecting team.  So far they had received all but one had sent in their all clear reports, while Ray's team was the last still searching the haggard battleship.  The ship had been found on the cost by a small scouting team who had been searching for anything that would help them flee the decaying world around them.   Despite the ship being clear so far, the team and the last remnants of humanity on the shore were uneasy.

The team members who had been responsible for determining if their great hope would be able to forge out into the vastness of the ocean had reported that it was seaworthy.  The last stop in the grand search was the galley, by Ray's team.  The marine looked at the last two remaining members of his team and waited for their nod to his unasked question.  Once they gave it, he waited for the member on his right to position himself to open the door.  When ready Ray nodded to his fellow marine, and Charles opened the door a moment before Ray kicked the door in and shoved his rifle into the room.

The room, just like everywhere else, was dark but Ray had grown so accustomed to the darkness that he was able to track a bit of motion in the back of the galley.  And instinctively the grizzled marine pulls his rifle to his shoulder and controls his breathing as he squared the rifleâ€™s sight upon the movement he had seen before he squeezed the trigger.  The bolt of pale blue energy flew from the barrel of his rifle and lit the room in a pale glow for an instant.  Unfortunately, that instant was all he needed to see the vastness of the infestation in the galley.

The room was full of the creature that had devastated humanity.  Those things were creatures of humanity's own creation and the fact that the monsters were made while trying to find cures for a wide array of diseases ultimately didn't matter.  These creatures were mishappened, but they were not the lumbering hulks they appeared to be instead they were dangerously fast and exceptionally strong.  Thankfully these rifles were just the weapons needed to put these creatures down.  So the bolt that was racing through the galley impacted with the creature that had pulled Ray's eyes towards it.

As the light dissipated and the creature was falling to the floor, Ray was able to hear the motions from the rest of the infestation.  He instantly cleared the doorway crying out, "Light'em up we have a nest!"

Without argument, the other two marines pulled their own rifles to their shoulders and squeezed their triggers as quickly as they could move the ends of their weapons.  Bolt after bolt of pale blue light poured into the doorway lighting up the galley and their portion of the hallway.  Ray could see as each of the creatures turned to try and force its way out of the confined galley.  And as each attempted to make it through the doorway a bolt from one of the three rifles would pierce the creature forcing it to fall upon the floor.

There were so many of these creatures that as each of the three marines depleted their rifles power cell, the quickly and efficiently swapped it out for a fresh one.  Each kept firing until they were down to their last cell.  Once they all stopped shooting Ray pulled out a small sphere from his belt as he pressed its single button.  He released the button and counted to two before he tossed it into the galley.  The sphere hung in mid-air and began to glow like a miniaturized sun.  

Now that the galley was lit with its own personalized star Ray was able to see everything in the room as clearly as if they were outside.  The three marines stood in the hallway and waited for something in the galley to move.  After waiting for what felt like an hour, Ray took a tentative step towards the room and pulled out a handheld periscope to see if any creatures were hiding just inside the doorframe.  Thankfully when Ray looked through his invaluable tool, he saw that there wasn't a single creature still standing.

Ray put the periscope into his pocket and readied his rifle as he took his first step into the galley.  Of course, that was when one of the creatures made a lurching motion which prompted Ray to fire at its middle.  The creature fell forward knocking an item from the table flinging it at Ray.  When it struck the floor, Ray bent over and carefully lifted the object but kept his men from seeing it.

"Ray, what was that?"

"It was a stranger, Kevin," Charles answered for his leader.

"I know what the creature was!"  Kyle quipped before he asked Ray, "What was that thing that flew towards you?"

Ray lifted the object above his head answering, "Its a whisk."

"A whisk?"  Charles asked.

Ray laughed as he dropped the metallic whisk to the floor carefully examining the remains of the bodies scattered around the galley's floor.  After an intensive examination of the remains, Ray opened his radio to the global channel.  "We have a lot of cleanup to get done, but we are good to get our ride off the mainland to safety."
