I learned about NYC Midnight's Annual Flash Fiction Challenge this past September.  And after having experimented with the format, I got excited about taking part in the competition.  Unfortunately for me, this contest begins in July, which meant that I missed out on the opportunity to flex my muscles in this contest.  Looking at the varied prompts in the first list of participating writers, I knew that I would need to practice.  So I decided to take advantage of those prompts by picking ones at random and giving myself forty-eight hours to complete my story.<!-- more -->
 
Knowing that the competition would start in July, I kept my eye out on their [website](http://www.nycmidnight.com), so I could pounce on the opportunity.  Well, when NYC Midnight announced the 11th Annual Flash Fiction Challenge, I registered for it back in May, and I marked my Calendar for July 12th, the date of the first challenge.
 
This past Friday, I received my first prompt.  I needed to write a comedy taking place in a movie theater and including a sword.  Comedy is not my forte, and to all the writers who make their living working in this format, I tip my hat to you.  I spent the first leg of the competition trying to figure out a storyline and how to make it work as a comedy.
 
I finally found a story, and it ended firmly in the thriller genre.  Throughout the next few revisions, I furiously worked on weeding out most of the thriller aspects and layer in campiness to the story.  When I finished, I looked at my first entry my excitement skyrocketed.  Right now, I'm waiting to hear back from the judges, I'm eager to get their constructive feedback and to see how I did in the first challenge.
