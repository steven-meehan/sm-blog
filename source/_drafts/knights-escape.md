Ezikial was standing among his guards, hands zip-tied behind his back, as he thought about how this had happened.  He had stumbled upon this conspiracy, and he didn't know who he could trust at this point.  The only reason he was alive, despite being in captivity, was because of his training.  His special forces days transformed him into the living weapon he actually was.  Unfortunately, he couldn't even handle the sheer number of minions in this conspiracy.

"Stop eyeballing me."  One of his guards said irately.

"Calvin, calm down and relax."  The steely-eyed man shifted his gaze from the guard to Ezikial. "Our friend here will answer all our questions."

Ezikial mentally chuckled at the lofty words, he had ducked into the Rotunda because a senator was being honored in death.<!-- more -->  He had managed to secure a few minutes of peace.

"Now, Ezikial, please to spare us any further unpleasantness tell me where you hid the flash drive."

Ezikial shifted his eyes from the man's feet to his cold and calculating eyes quipping, "You're rapidly running out of time."

One of the guards pulled him up and growled, "So are you."

"I've got all the time in the world."

"You're zip-tied and unarmed, what makes you think you're going to walk away from this?"

Ezikial turned to look at the man as he answered, "Because I'm better than you."

The man pulled his fist back and was about to throw a punch when Ezikial's hand flew to the man's holster and pulled the gun and shot the man in the chest.  Before anyone could react, Ezikial had spun and pulled the gun from the steely-eyed leader's holster shooting him in the chest as well.

Ezikial spun and studied the remaining dozen thugs.  Fortunately, once he had been subdued the leader had dismissed two-thirds of their force thinking that fourteen men left would be able to handle a secured man.  Unfortunately for those remaining, he was better than fourteen, well twelve, armed men.

He leapt over the fallen senator's coffin, dragging the crest to the floor with him.  Ezikial waited for a pause in the ensuing explosions, then he looked over the coffin and with six well placed rounds half of the remaining thugs fell to the floor.  But before he could shift to the remaining, explosions announced the oncoming pieces of metal.  Ezikial spun placing his back to the marble the coffin was resting on, as he waited for his next opening he slipped the crest into his jacket pocket.

Turning around he eased his eyes over the lid of the coffin and caught sight of three men warily approaching the stand.  He dropped to the floor and rolled to the side, once he cleared the coffin’s stand he fired three shots dropping the three approaching men.  Without wasting any motions, he dropped the now empty gun as he got his feet under him and began racing for an exit.

As he ducked through the nearest doorway a bullet embedded itself into the door frame sending chips out like shrapnel from a mine.  One of those jagged pieces sliced Ezikial's cheek, and as the blood began to swell, he turned bringing the second gun he appropriated to bear upon the final man in the room.  He squeezed the trigger twice snuffing the sparkle from the eyes of two of the remaining thugs.

"You are certainly good."  The last man cried out.

"You can leave now, and I won't hurt you,"  Ezikial replied hoping the man would accept his arrangement.

The last man in the room walked towards the casket in the middle of the Rotunda, with great care saying, "If I let you out of here, I won't make it home."

"Your bosses are about to have bigger fish to fry than you."

"You making it out won't hurt them that much."

"I know I’ll never be more than an inconvenience your bosses, but all that incriminating evidence I managed to extract won't be just a mild irritation."

"You don't..."

"Last chance walk away and live."

The other man tried to dive behind the senator's final home, but Ezikial knew what he was trying to do.  And as the man began his last movement, Ezikial squeezed the trigger, and the bullet started its route.  Just before the thug's head disappeared behind the coffin, the shot ended its fatal journey.

Ezikial shakes his head at the senselessness of the deaths before he sought a way out as stealthily as he could.  He was surprised that the gunfire hadn't drew security already, but he was able to slip out of the building and reach a phone.  He called his contact, and in less than fifteen minutes he was able to extract the flash drive from the crest.  "You're sure you'll be able to get this to the world?"

"Have I ever let you down Ezikial?"

"Never, Jacob."

"Go lay low, you've done enough,"  Jacob said as he raised his window and sped off into the city to disseminate the information Ezikial risked his life to retrieve.
