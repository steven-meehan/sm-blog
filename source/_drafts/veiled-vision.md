Bethany was having an outstanding day, she was enjoying her family's mini-vacation at the beach.  Today was the last day of their trip and so she was walking along the shoreline for the last time.  She took comfort as the waves lapped up against her legs and the salt-laden wind nipped at her unbound hair, when she felt her bare foot step on something hard.  She bent down and quickly dug it out.

When the object broke through the wet sand she was shocked to find a pair of sunglasses in the sand.  She gently lifted them out of the sand and let the incoming waves clean the clinging sand from the frames.  She looked around but there were only a few people still there so she lifted, peering through them to see if they were corrective.  Her face lit up when her vision didnt distort as she took in the expansive waters through the greyish lenses.

She quickly rubbed the lenses dry with the edge of her shirt before she put them on.<!-- more -->  She turned to walk back towards her parents and noticed a strange man off to her right.  She hadnt seen him earlier, and she wondered what he was doing there.  He must have noticed her studying him because he began walking towards her.  She didnt want to deal with the stranger so she jogged back towards her parents.

As she went she kept looking over her shoulder and the man was still following her.  Each time she looked away from the stranger she forced herself to move just a little faster.  When she finally reached her father she collapsed and the glasses fell off her nose but the arms grasped her temples like a man hanging off the edge of a cliff.  Her father quickly came to her side helping her to her feet asking, "Darling are you okay?"

"Dad, there is someone chasing after me!"  Bethany said frantically.

Her father looked where she was pointing but shook his head slightly, "Bethany, I dont see anyone over there."

Bethany hugged her father with every bit of strength she could muster but she slowly twisted her head to point out the stranger.  But like her father had said he wasnt there.  She loosened her grasp on her father saying, "Dad there was a man chasing me."

Lifting her head up her father kissed her forhead and spoke with tenderness.  "If there was he's long gone darling.  He must have realized where you were going and he left you alone.  Why dont you wait here and enjoy the sunset with me."

Bethany shook her head and explained, "I think i can use some water and somethign to eat."

"Here is a little money, would you like me to go with you?"

Flashing an unsteady smile Bethany assured her father that she was fine.  She took the money and began walking towards the boardwalk, fully intending to get some fries and a soda.  As she approached the boardwalk the sun's light was beating upon her sxpoed eyes and she lifted her hand to shade her eyes.  When her hand brushed the arm of the sunglasses she remembered she had found them and slipped them back on her face.  She came eye to eye with the stranger.

Bethany yelped and leapt backwards, fortunate that she didnt fall or collide with anything.  But the man immeadiately appeared next to her and placed his hand upon hers and she began hearing his voice, "...need your help."

Bethany tried to pull her hand away from the man but she found that she couldnt move it.  She began taking shallow rapid gulps for air, as she grew more fantic each time her arm refused to budge.  The man but his nose next to hers and said with great deliberence.  "Please, can you help me.  I have been searching for someone who could see me.  I need your help."

The girl studied those glazed over brown eyes and nervously asked, "Who are you?"

"My name is Kevin Johnson, please help me."

"Why have you been following me?"  Bethany asked pleadingly.

"Because you can see me with the sunglasses, and I need your help."

"Why do you need my help?"  Bethany asked her frantic mind slowing down.  Then she realized something, "Why can I only see you with the sunglasses."

"I'm dying, please help me."

"Dying?"

"Yes please come with me," Kevin said.  However before she could respond the spry dying man led her to a place close to where she found the sunglasses and there washed up on the surf was the twin of the man pulling her along.

"Who are you?"  Bethany asked as she tried yanking her arm free again.

"If you dont help me I will die."  Kevin said as he emphatically pointed at the still form lying on the sand.  Kevin's face became desperate as he wailed, "Please help me."

Bethany thought for a moment before she rushed to action.  She lifted the body as best she could and dragged him towards the sparsely populated part of the beach.  After what felt like hours she heard the shrill sound of a whistle.  Moments later her heavy burden was lifted from her and the swarming lifeguards began exercising their craft to revive Kevin. 

She edged away looking at the duplicate Kevin.  As the lifeguards worked the copy began drifting towards the still form.  As the copy was becoming one with the body on the ground it mouthed two words, "Thank you."  Then both were joined and the still man began coughing as color began flooding back into him.

Bethany stood up but one of the guards grabbed her and pulled her closer to Kevin, "Sir this woman is resposible for saving your life."

The man looked up as he gripped his chest, "Thank you mis.  THank you."

Bethany blushed as she looked awy, but she warmly replied, "Your welcome."
