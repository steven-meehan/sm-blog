Lucas was groggy when his kidnapper threw him to the ground in front of a
junkyard entrance.  He sat upon the ground dumbfounded as he listened to the man's blunt words, "I'll give you a full minute head start."

Blinking at the bright light of the sun, Lucas dumbfoundedly asked, "What?"

The stranger leaned over Lucas and spoke clearly, "Run."

"What?"  Lucas asked as he tried to steady himself as he lay upon the ground.

The man shouldered his rifle, pulling out a handgun and fired at the ground next to Lucas, who was shocked to full awareness.<!-- more -->  "The next one wouldn't miss, Lucas.  Now run, and make the chase marvelous."

It took Lucas a few tries, but he was eventually able to climb to his feet.  He made a few unsteady steps, but the man had begun counting. "One, two, three..."

Lucas' face went slack as he realized that the man was serious.  He spun around with a great effort not to fall as he plunged into the junkyard.  Moments after entering he realized that it was a giant maze.  In another few moments, Lucas ran himself into a dead end.  He instinctively looked behind him and didn't see his pursuer, and he knew what he had to do.  Lucas flung himself to the top of the blocking wall and briefly searched his surroundings.  A smile jumped to his lips as he noticed a vast parking lot with a solitary car.

He continued through the maze, searching for the far wall climbing walls occasionally to keep himself pointed in the right direction.  He was within sight of the last wall when a bullet grazed his cheek.  Without thinking, he grabbed a chunk from the wall.  His hands flew across the still smooth surface of the hubcap, as he spun around he instantly caught sight of his hunter and threw the piece towards his assailant.  The hubcap's flight was true, and the collision made the man look away.

Lucas seized the moment and desperately climbed up the wall of junk and without looking down he flung himself over the edge.  The elation from escape was momentary, he quickly found himself sliding down a mountain of junk.  When he finally came to a stop halfway down the mountainside, Lucas ignored the flowing blood of his injuries as he flung himself towards the car.

When he reached the car, his hands yanked on the handle, but the door wouldn't open.  Looking back from where he fled from he thought he saw something poking up from the ridge of junked things.  He ran to the other side of the car and hid.  As he sat there the fear that had spurned him to flee was screaming that he needed to continue his flight.  Yet he knew that with the rifle he was nothing more than a target to his hunter.

As he tried to gather his wits, Lucas thought he heard a small sound a moment before he felt the car rock sharply from an impact.  Without moving, Lucas looked around and saw that one of the tires had been blown out.  His fear grew as another slight sound warned of another shot and just like that another tire blew out.  Yet somehow Lucas kept his fear from forcing him into a run.

With two of the tires shot out, Lucas knew that the car wouldn't be going anywhere, but he stayed right where he was.  As three more shots rang out and struck the car's engine.  Lucas waited for another shot to ring out, but after a dozen deep breaths, there was nothing.  He risked a glimpse over the hood of the car and noticed a man rapidly charging down the hill with the rifle slung across his back.  Lucas dropped back to the pavement and looked for something to use when the man got closer, but there was nothing.

Risking another look over the hood, he saw the man pointing the handgun towards him, and he dropped down just in time to here the explosion of a shot.  He tore his shoes off and tossed one over the hood of the car, and when he heard the shot, he jumped up and threw the other shoe right at the man's head.  It impacted with the man's head causing him to lose track of Lucas, who seized that moment to try and survive.

Lucas managed to grab his assailant's gun hand as he struck the man's temple.  Keeping a firm grasp upon the man's gun hand, Lucas repeatedly struck out at the man who was continuing to struggle in an attempt to extricate himself.  But with each of Lucas' strikes, the man struggled less.  Eventually, the man drew a knife and lashed out at Lucas.  Fortunately, Lucas managed to glimpse the knife and was barely able to block the blow.  Tightening his grip upon the man's wrist, Lucas struck at the man's head with all his strength, dropping the man instantly.

Lucas fell to his knees and secured the gun, then he tied up his hunter letting himself smile at his survival.
