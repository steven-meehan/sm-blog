Pulling the note from his pocket, Lucious reread it: Come to the museum and sit down in from of the three portraits.  Be there at two in the afternoon.  Lucious looked at his watch and mumbled, "Fifteen minutes early."  Lucious shoved the note into his pocket and sat down on the couch in the middle of the room.  Staring up into the center portrait, Lucious studied the woman and child.  While he took in the colors upon the canvas, Lucious rubbed at his bald spot.  He closed his eyes as he removed his glasses and rubbed the weariness from his eyes.

A man with grey hair escaping from under his baseball cap sat down next to him.  As the two stared at the portrait, the old man asked, "How are you doing, Lucious?"

Lucious cocked his head to stare at the man.  Blinking, he asked, "Do I know you?"

The man's laugh felt familiar, and when it died off, he pulled his hat off, pulling his left leg up onto the couch.  Turning with deliberate slowness, he looked Lucious in the eye, then he leaned closer to Lucious and answered, "I know you very well, Lucious.  Though you'll know me better in the future."

Lucious scoffed as he pulled out the note, "Is this your handiwork?"

The greying man smiled and gave a curt nod, "I needed to speak with you, Lucious."

Shaking his head, Lucious stood up, but the old man grabbed his arm and pulled him back to the couch.  "Lucious, I already told you that we need to talk."

"I don't know you," Lucious stated as he leaned into the old man.  "And since I don't know you I'm not going to talk to you."

Flashing Lucious a smile, the old man grabbed Lucious's shoulders and whispered, "Do you remember what you did when you were twelve?"

"What?" Lucious asked as he tried to squirm out of the older man's grasp.

"When you were twelve," the greying man said with a coy smile.  "You snuck into your parent's liquor cabinet and swiped a bottle."

"How could you know that?"  Lucious demanded as he ripped the older man's arms from his shoulders.  "Only my parents knew about that!"

The old man's smile continued to spread, showing his teeth, "Of course, that's not the interesting part of the story."

“Yeah, yeah okay,” Lucious said tersely.  "Who are you, and how do you know about that?"

The elderly man wrung his cap and turned to stare at the mother and child.  After a few moments of reflection, he pointed at the painting and asked, "What does this painting say to you?"

"What?"

"Your first thoughts," the older man clarified.

Harumphing Lucious stalked to the portrait stuffing his hands into his pockets.  He studied the painting, and without turning around, he replied, "Love and beauty."

"Love and beauty," the other man repeated in a whisper.  "Two simple words that have such meaning for everyone don't you think?"

With a scowl, Lucious stalked over to the man and demanded, "Who are you?"

"You have a choice to make in a couple of days," the man said as he removed his glasses and started to clean them.  "Remember those words when your choice is upon you."

"Seriously, who are you?"  Lucious demanded as he grabbed at his thinning hair.

The man put his glasses back on and casually stood up, "I hope we never meet again, Lucious."  The man bowed his head and continued, "When the time comes, remember what you saw here."

The older man pointed at the portrait, and then he tapped Lucious's chest, "And remember to follow those words when your choice comes."  He turned and started walking away but stopped and turned around, "Your choice will have a greater impact than you can ever know, Lucious.  Make the choice wisely."

The man resumed his walk out of the hall.  It took Lucious a moment to recover from the simple words, but once he recovered, he ran to catch up with the elderly man.  He grabbed the old man's arm and spun him around and whispered, "Who are you?"

The man chuckled as he eased Lucious's hand from his arm.  Then he laid his hand upon Lucious's back and pulled him closer to him, and with a wink, he asked, "Who do you think I am, Lucious?"

"No," Lucious protested.

"Why do you think that?"  The elderly man asked as he pulled Lucious closer to him.

"The only thing I can think of doesn't make sense," Lucious quavered.  He rubbed his bald spot and stuttered, "Wh... What I th... think isn't possible."

"Of course you're right, Lucious," the older man agreed.  With a grin, he pulled the cap onto his head and pulled Lucious even closer, "As of right now the explanation circling around in your mind is impossible.  But that doesn't mean that such an explanation is impossible for me."

"How?  Why?  How?" Lucious asked as he timidly reached out for the man across from him.

"I can't tell you anything," the elderly man said as he waved a finger in front of his face.  "As far as why?  Well, I'm here to make sure you tread the right path."  The older man pulled a device from his pocket and smiled, "Remember your first thoughts of the painting."

The man let go of Lucious and walked into the shadows and waved at Lucious.

Returning the wave, Lucious said, "Thank you, Lucious."  He scoffed and added, "It's not often I thank myself for quality advice."

"Goodby, Lucious," the older copy of Lucious said as he pressed the button and vanished.

Lucious grinned and walked out of the museum as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
