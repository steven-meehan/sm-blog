Leaning along the edge of the enclosed bridge, Kyle Rickman was staring out into his city.  His left hand was cradling a precious cargo, the notebook for his active case.  He had been working it for a few days.  Kyle's frown was warmed a little by the rising sun, but he fought the smile as he scratched the stubble invading his chin.  He turned around and quickly opened the notebook to review everything he had managed to discover for the case, which at the moment wasn't enough to help his client.

He tapped his pencil on the new potential lead, hoping that his friend would be able to run the test quickly.  Putting his pencil into his shirt pocket, Kyle grabbed his phone to call the lab and demand an update when a call from his office came in.<!-- more --> "Gregory, what do you want?"

"I'm sorry, but I thought you wanted immediate updates, partner."

"What, do you have, Gregory?"

"Well, there's nothing to disprove your theory."

"Which means there’s no evidence that it's what actually happened."

"The victim identified our client as the attacker, Kyle, this was not a good job to take."

"Remember two a few things.  First, we met when you were framed.  Second, the victim admits to being struck from behind and only getting a view of someone as she regained consciousness."

"I know Kyle, but it's hard to keep that in mind when you review the prosecutor’s case."

"And Third I found a syringe that was buried where the assault took place."

"You're not exactly in the best part of the city, Kyle."

"It's also not a ghetto, but that's why it’s off to be tested."

"Who's delivering it?"

"Thomas."

He'll ensure the custody of that, but he's not cheap."

"I'll worry about that you make your way to the lab and make sure they don't screw it up."

"Yes, sir."

Going back to his notebook Kyle read the statements, and the consensus was she walked from east to west which meant she passed that small tower.  Walking over to the tower Kyle quickly discovers it was an ATM, and he instantly calls Dwayne.

Silence greeted Kyle when the ringing stopped, but he just says, "Hello Dwayne I need something."

"What?"

"I need some pictures of a particular atm."

"Good for you."

"I'm serious."

"Fine, who owns it?"

Kyle quickly found the bank and passed that along, "Can you get into it?"
"Probably but given your line of work, I'll assume you want something a little more on the up and up than me hacking into the machine."

"What can you do?"

"I know some of the cyber guys at all the major banks."

"Really?"

"We're a small community."

"Okay, what's that get me?"

"A copy of the pictures you need, what’s the date and time."

Moments later Kyle is looking through images on his phone and is amazed at the detail, though he is a little skeptical as to how Dwayne had managed to get them that fast.  But it didn’t matter, he had the photo of the victim, and he was lucky in a day or two the image would have been gone.

Kyle called his friend over at the police and asked him to come to the skywalk, and about twenty minutes later Kyle's friend and another officer arrived.

The other officer spoke first, "Why are you poking into my case?"

"Because my client is innocent."

"We have an id from the victim!"

I think these will clear my client." Kyle said as he handed the police officers the photos he had managed to print off, at the convince store around the corner.

"What are they?" The officer asked.

"See that ATM?"

"You hacked an ATM?!" The officer asked as he pulled a pair of handcuffs.

"Absolutely not."

"How'd you get it Kyle?" his friend asked.

"Look another day, and they will be off the ATM, so if you please can we skip the small talk.  This clearly states that the victim walked past the ATM a good four hours before she was found by my client, not to mention there is a man who is different enough from my client with a syringe in the next photo."

"We don’t know what’s in the syringe."

"I found a syringe over by where the attack took place."

"Where is it?"

"Taken to the lab that you all contract out."

"How did it get there?"

"Thomas." Kyle's phone rings and he excuses himself, and he is being told by his partner that the chemical in the syringe is something rare and unpronounceable, but it can render someone unconscious very quickly.

"And about that other piece I wanted you to check on?"

"I don’t know how you do it, but you were right."

"Excellent," Kyle said as he hung up and turned around, "Gentlemen I thought you should know that there is a rare drug in that syringe that will render someone unconscious and that my client's brother is rather jealous of my client and has been promising that he would disgrace my client in the eyes of their parents."

The officer was furious, but he stalked away while Kyle's friend answered, "If that all checks out your client will be going home tonight, Kyle."

"It will."
