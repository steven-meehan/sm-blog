As Gregory leaned against the wall of the clocktower the tears flowed from his eyes as he kept protesting his innocence.  But those words fell upon the deaf ears of Rebecca and her partner, Frank.  They were standing next to their car and Frank asked, "Rebecca, are you sure about this?"

"Frank, you saw the same thing I did,"  Rebecca answered with the same emotions of a stone.

"Rebecca, this..."

She spun to face her partner and shoved a finger into his face as she continued on without a slip of emotion.  "Frank, we found him drenched in blood kneeling over the victim.<!-- more -->"  With eyes closed she grimly concluded, "My past relationship with him won't be relevant."

Frank rubbed his eyes before exclaiming, "You know it will, just like you know you can't be the one to arrest him.  We need to report it then babysit him for someone else."

Turning her back on her partner her eyes were seething as she stared at Gregory but she finally relented muttering, "Fine call it in, Frank."

Frank watched as Rebecca stalked back to the crime scene but he picked up his radio and made the report and requested another car, to arreest the weeping Gregory.  However, before the requested officers could arrive a nondescript car arrived and middle aged athleticly built man got out.  With a harumph Frank walked over and put his hands upon the man ordering, "I'm sorry sir, you're going to have to leave."

The man watched as Rebecca led Gregory into the car and calmly said, "I'm afraid I have a client over there."  

Frank looked where the man pointed and asked, "Layer?"

"No, I'm with Insight Investigations." The man said promptly as he proffered his credentials, "And he has a right to hire me to investigate this alleged crime."

"Leave."  Frank ordered after glancing at the license.

"Since you haven't actually arrested him yet, I believe I'm allowed to offer him my services.  And you should probably keep your partner from stuffing him in that car, unless you're going to arrest him afterall."

"Fine," Frank said with annoyance, but he looked over at Rebecca and said, "Dont put him in there Rebecca, we're going to wait and he has a guest."

The private eye waited until both detectives were far enough away before he whispered to Gregory, "I'm Kyle Rickman, Insight Investigations."

"I've never heard of you."

"This would be my first case."

"So why help me?"  Gregory asked with his head hanging.

"I could hear your pleas, and i know the voice of an innocent man."

"They don't believe me, and I can't pay you," Gregory said dejectedly.

"We can work those details later, now tell me what happened."

"I proposed, Veronica said yes and then I was hit on the back of the head, and I went out like a light."

"Nice summary,"  Kyle began before he looked back at Rebecca and idly said, "It seems that the female officer..."

"Rebecca."

The investegator's head spun around instatnly as he asked, "You know her?"

"She's an ex..."

"Bad breakup?"

"It certainly wasnt civil."

"No wonder, her partner insisted on another officer arresting you."  Kyle said as he twirled a pen in his hand.

"I didn't do it."  Gregory insisted.

Nodding the investigator said, "I believe you..."

"Gregory."

"Then let me see what I can find to clear you."

"Thank you."

The investigator walked to the edge of the clock tower and peeked past the taped.  While he was taking everything in Rebecca came up and grabbed his shoulder and asked, "What do you think you're doing?"

Kyle quickly examined Rebecca before he answered, "Investigating for my client."

"Back off!"

With another look at the officer Kyle asked, "You normally carry a lot of things in your pockets?"

"My pockets are empty, now back off!"  Rebecca demanded.

"You know I already showed your partner my credentials, not to mention that I haven't actually crossed the yellow line.  I've not done anything I'm not allowed to do."

With a snarl plastered upon her face, Rebecca threatened, "Don't pollute the crime scene."

"Wouldn't dream of it lass,"  Kyle said with a smile and a small salute as he went back to investigate the scene.  He examined Veronica despite the distance and the blanket's obstruction.  But he saw enough and when he was finished he went over to Rebecca's partner and asked, "Was anything removed from the victim's body?"

"No."

Nodding Kyle walked over to his client and asked, "Did you put the ring on her finger?"

"Yes, I did."

Kyle smiled as he turned to watch four officers walking over, the arresting officers had arrived.  Leaning against the car Kyle spoke over the sirens.  "Can you check Rebecca's right pocket for an engagement ring?"

"What?" Rebecca cried out nervously.

"The ring isnâ€™t on the body, and it should be."

"Excuse me?"  Rebecca's partner asked as his hand slowly moved towards his gun.

"There's a slight bulge in her right pant's pocket, slight to be from my client's engagement ring."

The three officers slowly turned to look at Rebecca who's hands had clapped down upon the pocket as if she were trying to hide it from view.

"Rebecca, turn out your pocket."  One of the new arrivals said evenly.

Rebecca began to focus her eyes upon Gregory, as her other hand tightened upon her weapon's grip.  Wetting her lips Rebecca tried to pull her gun, but was tackled to the ground by the newly arrived officers who quickly subdued her.

As they put her into their car, Frank walked over and uncuffed Gregory saying, "I'm so sorry, sir."

"Can I get the ring back?"  Frank asked dumbly.

"Of course,"  Frank said with a hollow voice as he went to retrieve it.

"Thank you Kyle,"  Gregory said as he emphatically shook the investigator's hand.

"I'm just doing my job,"  Kyle said with joy and sorrow tugging at his mouth.
