"We're over the ships, Cederic," Sybell said as she swiveled away from her consoles.
"Excellent," Cederic answered as he brought the shuttle to a near motionless hover.  "Have we gotten any more information about those ships?"
"No," Sybell answered.
"How deeply are they buried?" Cederic asked as he tightened his grip on the controls.
"Fortunately, the ships are close to the surface" Sybell chirped.  Returning her attention to the console she added, "We should be able to gain access to the ships in short order."
With careful control, Cederic guided their shuttle into position, "Sybell start making the path."
"On it sir," Sybell answered.
Tapping at his comms Cederic ordered, "Jeras, Ronald and Tegan, grab your gear and get ready to explore the first ship."
"Yes, sir," Tegan squeaked.
"What will we be looking for?" Jeras asked with his resonate voice.
With another adjustment the shuttle lowered until the grass on the planet could barely tickle the hull.  "Why would I know what you're looking for?  These ships are ancient Larian ships, on a planet that doesn't exist in the Larian database.  Get in and get as much as you can while the rest of us perform our aerial survey."
"Yes, sir," Ronald answered.  "How are we getting in?"
"I've just finished the tunnel," Sybell chimed in.  "Everyone grab your climberâ€™s boots."
"Tana and Evans you stay here and help everyone get back in," Cederic said as a little gust of wind lifted the shuttle.  "Meanwhile Colton, Elyas, Preston, Aiden and Giselle you all get ready for the larger ship."
The crew replied, "Yes, sir."
Wincing Sybell turned off her comms, "They could at least try to say it in unison."
"Bah," Cederic answered as he maneuvered the shuttle so the ramp would lead right to the fresh tunnel to the ship, "I don't care about that."
"About what sir?" Tegan asked.
"Nothing, now get in and explore that ship team one." Cederic said as he lowered the shuttle's ramp.  A couple of minutes later the first team cut their way into the ship and started their exploration.  Without waiting for another word, Cederic hurried over to the second ship and repeated the process for the larger team.
Once the second team started their search, Sybell asked, "What are we going to do now?"
Cederic closed the ramp and the shuttle tore up in the sky, "Now we begin our aerial scan of the planet."
"Yippee," Sybell moaned.
"I know," Cederic offered sympathetically.  "But we need to know as much as we can about the planet."  Tapping his comms Cederic asked, "Tana how many survey drones do we have?"
"We have five drones," she replied instantly.
"Launch them," Cederic ordered.  "We'll study the area surrounding the impact."
Sybell's head whipped around, "Cederic, Tegan has news for you."
Adjusting his comms Cederic demanded, "What do you have Tegan?"
"Cederic, Laria tried to colonize this world," Tegan babbled.  "But when the attempt failed they waited centuries before sending a second ship to investigate.  But that ship vanished as well."
"Then what?"  Cederic asked as he started the scans of the crash site.
"Well then I don't know," Tegan protested.  "I'm piecing all of this together from the logs of both ships.  Preston is on the older ship and we've been trading info, but I figured you'd want to know what we've found so far."
"Tegan!" Aiden's scream sliced into the conversation.
"Yes, Aiden," Cederic said as he settled the shuttle from the turbulence that formed at the suddenness of the interruption.  "What can we do for you?"
"Cederic come pick us up!"  Aiden cried out but his voice couldn't drown out the sounds of weapons fire.
"What's going on?"  Tegan asked her voice quavering.
"We need to be picked up to Cederic," Jeras cried out as he broke into the private channel.
More shots rang out before Aiden replied, "Monsters are charging our position.  We need to fall back, Cederic come get us."
Cederic abandoned his survey and went back to hover over the larger ship.  "Get as much of the ship's database as you can and then use your climbers and get up here!  Tegan we'll be over your position in a minute."
More shots rang out from Aiden's comm, "We're coming up now, Cederic and we have about fifty percent of the database."
"Ramp is opening now," Cederic altered his comms channel. "Tana and Evans are you all ready?"
"Yes," Evans responded.  "And we have the team onboard."
Switching back to the open channel Cederic asked, "Any injuries?"
"No," Aiden replied.  "But can we pick up Tegan's team?"
"We're getting into position now," Cederic assured the rest of his team.  "What was attacking you?"
"Monsters," Aiden muttered.  "Monsters and nightmares."
"We have Tegan's team," Tana chirped.  "And they appear to be uninjured."
"Aiden, is your team okay?" Cederic asked force filling his tone.
"Strafe the ships, Cederic," Aiden demanded.  "We need to strafe the ships.  We need to wipe out whatever those things are.  We have some heavy weapons on this shuttle let's burn everything."
"Aiden, we will not burn anything," Cederic decreed.  "Bring up whatever you managed to copy form the databases."
"Yes, sir," Aiden said with defiance and contempt in his voice.
"We'll be up soon," Tegan added as if she was mediating between two angry children.
"Cederic," Sybell whispered.
Cederic switched to a private channel with Sybell and asked, "What's wrong, Sybell?"
"We're getting data back from the drones."
"We're supposed to," Cederic said trying to dismiss her.
"We need to get out of here," Sybell screamed.  "Get us out of the atmosphere!  Get us out now before it's too late!"
"What do you mean?"
Sybell's hands danced along her keypad and then an image flooded onto Cederic's display.  Large winged and scaled creatures stared out of the screen.  "What are those he whispered?"
"No idea," Sybell cried.  "But they've destroyed two of our drones.  Can we please escape?!"
With a sharp nod, Cederic rocketed off towards the saftey of space.
