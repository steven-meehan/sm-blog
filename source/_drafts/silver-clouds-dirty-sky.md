While I love reading, being an adult is very time consuming. Whenever I look up vast swaths of free time have been gobbled up by something, and I can’t grab my kindle to find a place to read. Fortunately, for a select few books, there’s an excellent alternative, audio books. And the best place to get that variant is [Audible](https://www.audible.com). I’ve been a member of that service for a long time now, and it’s allowed me to read while doing things that wouldn’t allow me to read a book, like on my daily commute. So, I’m always looking to add quality books to my collection. Thankfully, the [Montague & Strong Case Files](https://www.audible.com/series/Montague-Strong-Case-Files-Series-Audiobooks/B07CCMN7ZW) fit the bill.<!-- more -->

Each installment is packed full of interesting characters. The dynamic between the titular characters (Simon and Tristan) is priceless, and ever since Peaches the Hellhound joined the series, I’ve been eager to grab each installment as they’ve been migrated to Audible. When I finished [Blood is Thicker](https://www.audible.com/pd/Blood-Is-Thicker-Audiobook/B08629JNZM), I vividly remembered that it marched right into, [Silver Clouds Dirty Sky](https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Clouds-Dirty-Sky-Detective/dp/B08BRZL95J). The only instance where leaving a storyline dangling is okay, is a clear-cut multi-part novel, i.e., a Part One or Part Two, and a trilogy. 

Typically, when this happens, I’m done with the author. However, there are two reasons I ignored that trick. The first is how late I discovered the series. Orlando Sanchez has published a lot of the books. The other is the trio of Tristan, Simon, and Peaches. 

These characters are too addictive for me to write off. Thankfully, this installment doesn’t disappoint. Their antics continue to pull me into their stories. Having rescued Michiko from the Blood Hunters, Dex teleported everyone across the pond, depositing them in London. Before they can say a word, the group gets sucked into the local politics and carnage ensues. As they escape from the fire, they wind up needing to deal with an infestation of demons.

With each page, Orlando Sanchez strikes the perfect balance between action and dispensing knowledge. Every tidbit brings a little more of the mystery, allowing everyone to follow the unfolding plot. The ending of this story is satisfying. Unfortunately, just like Blood is Thicker, Orlando has shoved a scene into the book that sets up the major conflict of the next book. This is my main issue with this series to date. Fortunately, for Mr Sanchez, his characters help me get past this significant drawback.
