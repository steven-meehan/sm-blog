Before the ship left Latria, the captain opened communications with the government back home and let them know what they had found on the planet below them.  They were told to continue on with their journey to Medicia shared the same fate as Latria.  So the captain plotted a course, but before the ship left orbit, all members of the landing crew were ordered to report to the infirmary.  They were forced into isolation so the doctors could ensure that their exposure to the radiation did no lasting harm.

While the trip to Medicia would take three weeks the landing crew had been isolated for the first two weeks of that journey.  After all of the tests were run and came up negative the doctors grudgingly allowed them to leave but insisted that they not take on any strenuous duties or activities.  Once Rylan was released the captain immediately ordered him to his ready room.<!-- more -->

When Rylan was able to get there, the captain looked up at him and greeted him, "Well Rylan I think you've finally been truly vindicated."

"It's amazing how that happened," Rylan answered bluntly.

With a chuckle, the captain nodded and commented, "People can be like that Rylan."  He rubbed his chin before he went on to the real reason he had summoned the technician.  "We are a week out from Medicia, but I don't want you going down to the planet."

"Why?"

"Because I will need you to go down to Laria, and I won't expose you to that radiation that many times."

"You're getting a little ahead of yourself aren't you?"  Rylan asked confused.

"Not really."

"What aren't you telling me?"

The captain looked from side to side before he stood up and walked over to the large window of his ready room he stared out at the stars letting silence envelop the room.  As the silence began to become uncomfortable he went on, "The best scientists back home are fairly sure that the reason we can't connect to Laria is that the radiation destroyed the platforms."

"What?"

The captain turned around and stared into Rylan's eyes as he answered the question.  "They were able to identify the radiation, Rylan."

"What is it?"

"It's over my head, all I remember is that there were a few scientists on Laria that were experimenting with it and they think it was able to flood through the platforms into all the Federation worlds."

"So..."

The captain sat on a corner of his desk and spoke over Rylan, "The only reason our world escaped the devastation is because you were running an update on our platform."

Rylan laughed bitterly, but he was quickly able to reign it in as he guessed what their new mission was.  "I take it we're going to confirm that's what we think happened actually happened?"

The captain nodded and gave Rylan his new orders, "Yes.  Now go and rest we will be at Medicia in a week, but then we have another two weeks to Laria, and I'll need you well rested for that."

Rylan acknowledged the orders and went to find something to occupy himself during the journey for the next three weeks.  Rylan busied himself passing on as much information about the platforms as possible to Rory, who had been tasked to do the check on Medicia's platform.  Rory was a sponge taking in every bit of information that Rylan could give him.  And when they entered orbit around the planet, Rylan reported to the bridge so he could help his replacement diagnose the platform if needed.

Of course, the same radiation that had enveloped Latria encompassed the world of Medicia as well.  So this team was given the same warning as before, and when the party landed, Rory led his five-man team to the platform room.  When he arrived, he quickly radioed up to the ship and announced that the platform's center crystal was flashing red.  Both teams rapidly returned to their shuttle and then the craft.

When the captain raised communications with homeworld, he made sure to include Rylan.  "Medicia is the same empty shell that Latria was."

"Thank you, captain." Aidan said promptly before looking to someone not in the picture asking, "Do we recall them?"

Rylan looked at his captain but ignored the silencing look he received.  "We can't just return, we need to go to Laria and see if we can find anything there."

"Whatever this radiation is, Rylan has devastated two planets that we know of and most likely all of the worlds in the Federation," Aidan replied smoothly.

"But we don't know we have to finish our investigation, there may yet be a planet that survived.  All of our communication runs through Laria we might be able to get a hint of a surviving planet."

The captain gave Rylan a brief nod before returning his attention to the screen, "Rylan is right."

"Of course he is,” came a voice that Rylan didn’t recognize from the other end of the conference.  “Go see what you can find."

"Yes, sir."  The captain answered as he shut down the communications.  He turned to look at Rylan and spoke solemnly, “Two dead worlds, two planet-wide graveyards.”

“I’m terrified that it might be all but one before the end,” Rylan said darkly.
