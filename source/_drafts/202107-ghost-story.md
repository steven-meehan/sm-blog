My creative portion of my mind works wonders at providing me an escape from reality. Unfortunately, some days that escape is easier than others, and ever June 30th ticked away, my escapes haven't been as effective. While I'm eventually able to fall into my creative headspace, once I'm there I'm too exhausted for some of my more typical sessions. As a result some of my normal writing has been put aside for the month, specifically all of my Wattpad publications. Hopefully, when August rolls around, I'll be past this funk and able to resume detailing all those storyline.<!-- more -->

But in the meantime, I'm dedicated to bringing my Patrons, their exclusive Flash Fiction content for the month. And the first genre I tackled was a Ghost Story. Halfway through my first draft, I stopped and looked at where the story was heading and sighed. Disgusted with where my mind tried to take this tale, I pivoted and adjusted the scope of the story. When I finished my initial draft, I was mostly happy with the overall tale. Thankfully, the point of the first draft is just to get words on the page. As I edited the document, the harsh storyline softened and I smiled at the completed narrative.

Sit down and get your popcorn ready as you follow the journey of a pair of ghosts in search for answers.

Following the instructions attached to his palm, our friendly shade enters a home, discovering an unknown face demanding his attentionâ€¦
