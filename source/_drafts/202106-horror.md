The moment I finished publishing [Finding Camp](/archives/2021/06/16/202106-comedy), my mind started processing my second Patreon exclusive. While my mind toiled to find its footing for my horror tale, I started thinking about my past work. Before I could delve into [Vengeful Shadow](/archives/2019/02/21/vengeful-shadow) or [The Pursuit](/archives/2018/11/01/the-pursuit), a stray thought crystalized in my mind. During Peter Capaldi’s run as the Doctor, there was an [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_&#40;Doctor_Who&#41;) that explored the concept of a creature that perfected the ability to hide. With the initial seed in place, I scurried to find a prompt so my version of the concept could grow.<!-- more -->

My initial thoughts for the story upended the horror aspect of the tale with a sibling eager to get even. However, it didn’t take long to dismiss that ending or most of the Doctor Who episode. Instead, as I worked on my first draft, my mind plucked aspects of [Supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_&#40;American_TV_series&#41;) out of the darkest corners of my mind and wove them into the narrative. During my first round of edits, I refined my new central character and saw some traits from Owen (from [Monster Hunter International](https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-International-Hunters-Book-ebook/dp/B00APAH7PQ)) and Kote (from the [Kingkiller Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind)), which made me smile.

But I pushed through the grin and continued editing my current horror tale. Sit down and get comfortable, so you can delve into the story.

Jacob saunter into his vacant home after the open house and samples the buffet. As he relaxes, a creak pulls him out of his revelry…

The man walked to the buffet and grabbed the knife from the table. He licked his lips while slicing a strip of brie from the wedge. The man snatched a slab of bread and folded it around the soft cheese as he twirled the blade. With a grunt, he slammed the utensil onto the table and took a bite as he sauntered toward his comfortable chair.

With a groan, he dropped into his recliner and popped the rest of the morsel into his mouth. While he finished the morsel, he reached down and grabbed the stack of documents and his phone. With a swipe of his thumb, he unlocked his device and dialed his realtor.

When the rings stopped, a gruff voice filled the silence. “Jacob, can’t this wait?”

“I’m looking for a simple answer.”

“You have all the paperwork.”

“It’s your job to translate this stack of files?” Jacob rolled the documents and struck his leg with the resulting tube. “Please bottom line this chaos for me?”
