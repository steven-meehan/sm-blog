The moment I finished publishing [Finding Camp](/archives/2021/06/16/202106-comedy), my mind started processing my second Patreon exclusive. While my mind toiled to find its footing for my horror tale, I started thinking about my past work. Before I could delve into [Vengeful Shadow](/archives/2019/02/21/vengeful-shadow) or [The Pursuit](/archives/2018/11/01/the-pursuit), a stray thought crystalized in my mind. During Peter Capaldi’s run as the Doctor, there was an [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_&#40;Doctor_Who&#41;) that explored the concept of a creature that perfected the ability to hide. With the initial seed in place, I scurried to find a prompt so my version of the concept could grow.<!-- more -->

My initial thoughts for the story upended the horror aspect of the tale with a sibling eager to get even. However, it didn’t take long to dismiss that ending or most of the Doctor Who episode. Instead, as I worked on my first draft, my mind plucked aspects of [Supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_&#40;American_TV_series&#41;) out of the darkest corners of my mind and wove them into the narrative. During my first round of edits, I refined my new central character and saw some traits from Owen (from [Monster Hunter International](https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-International-Hunters-Book-ebook/dp/B00APAH7PQ)) and Kote (from the [Kingkiller Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind)), which made me smile.

With a smile, I pushed through the realization and finished editing this horror tale. Sit down and get comfortable, so you can delve into this story.
