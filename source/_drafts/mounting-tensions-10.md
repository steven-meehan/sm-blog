Darvin’s fingers traced the outer hull of the vessel as he roamed around the spaceship. When he made a full circuit of the craft, he knocked his knuckles against the fuselage. Darvin wrung his hands and scurried across the warehouse to Rylan. “You weren’t kidding about the size of these ships.”

Rylan rubbed his jaw while his foot tapped the warehouse’s floor. “If I recall correctly, single seaters were all that I promised for your pilots.” Rylan ran his fingers through his hair and grinned. He gripped his quivering leg, stopping its motion. “I trust they’re able to pilot those.”
