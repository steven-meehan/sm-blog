The craft's journey was almost complete, and Rylan was having his last checkup with the doctors.  None of the crew who had been exposed to the radiation on either Latria or Medicia had begun to come down with symptoms of radiation sickness, but the captain was taking no chances.  So Rylan was being examined when the captain announced to the ship, "We are about three hours from entering the Larian system.  Any member of the landing party that has made planetfall so far needs to report to sickbay immediately."

Rylan looked at the doctor and spoke with a little humor behind his words, "Well doc, can you finish my exams before you get slammed with patients.<!-- more -->"

The steely older man looked at Rylan with a steady gaze as he answered, "No I'm not going to hurry up your exam, but no one else will be seen before you are.  Now be quiet and let me get to work."

Rylan shook his head and fell silent letting the doctor do his work to make sure he wasn't secretly dying.  He had just been examining last week and was diagnosed as clean, he didn't understand why the captain was this paranoid about the dangers from the radiation exposure.  From what he had seen on Lataria the radiation did its damage instantly not gradually.

When the doctor was done with the examination, he stepped away from the table saying, "Well all looks clear, there are no signs of any residual radiation in your system."

"Has anyone shown up with residual radiation from their exposure?"  Rylan asked as he rose from the table.

The doctor continued working on his pad answering, "You're not the captain, and you do not need to know, no out so I can see the next patient."

"Yes, sir."  Rylan chirped as he left sickbay.  He quickly made his way to the bridge to speak with the captain.  When he got there, he found the first officer currently in command and Rylan was directed to the captain's ready room.  He pressed int intercom and waited for the captain to let him in.

Rylan only waited for a moment before he heard the captain's voice telling him, "Come in."  So Rylan opened the door and walked in and was immediately greeted by the captain.  "I just got the word that you are in perfect health."

"How many people are experiencing radiation sickness?"

"The doctor told me you asked that."

"Captain, if I'm going to be leading the mission I need to know who I can take with me."

"That's what I told him, but so far everyone is in perfect health."

"How far out are we from the Larian system?"

The captain looked at one of the displays on his desk and then looked back up as he answered, "We should be entering the system at any moment."

"How quickly will we be able to scan the planet?"

"We should be able to determine the life signs once we drop into the system."  The captain said as he leaned back into his chair.  Then he folded his arms across his chest and asked, "Did you want to be here when we scan the system?"

"If you wouldn't mind sir," Rylan said without hesitation.

The captain sat back up and placed his elbows on the desk before putting his chin between his fingers and thinking about the request a little longer.  When he made his decision, he dropped his hands into his lap saying, "Certainly as far as I'm concerned you never did anything to our platform."

"Thank you sir," Rylan replied with a smile and a nod of his head.

One of the devices on the captain's desk chirped so the man in charge of safeguarding the vessel to Laria looked down and read the little message.  When he looked up, he caught sight of Rylan's eyes and said, "We managed to drop into the system early, let's go and find out what's going on in the system."

Rylan let the captain exit first, and once they were out of the room one of the officers was already addressing the captain.  "Sir we have an interesting development."

"Define interesting Tegan."  The captain demanded with weariness in his eyes as he sat in his chair.

Tegan did something with her controls, and the screen at the front of the bridge jumped to life displaying Larian solar system.  "Based on the records we know that the fourth planet from the star is Laria."

Noticing the issue the captain commented, "Which gives us two planets to choose from."

"Two planets?"  Rylan asked shocked at the development.

The captain gave Rylan a side glance as he inquired, "You didn't know about this?"

"No, I didn't and based on their position no one could really ever see it in the Larian night sky," Rylan answered as he took a couple steps closer to the display.

"Well, sir that's not the development."

Both Rylan and the captain spun their heads towards Teagan so fast they each almost fell down as they asked, "What?"

"From the records, we know that the dead planet is Laria, but the other planet is not in the records and is teeming with life," Tegan answered as she finally looked up from her displays.

"It's not in the records?"  Rylan asked dumbfounded that there was another planet capable of supporting life.

The captain calmed himself as he dismissed the anomalous planet as he asked, "What of Laria?"

Tegan held her captain's gaze and answered "Dead like Latria and Medicia.  But based on the state of the other planet they could have made it there before the disaster struck."

"Laria is dead?"  Rylan asked numbly.

"So it would seem."  The captain answered just as numb.
