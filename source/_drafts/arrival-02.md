Nathaniel is standing on the beach of the closest continent, watching as everyone who had been on the Novus spilled out into their world.
 
Marcus tapped his friend's shoulder and said, "That should be the last of the supplies."
 
"Which way are they heading?"
 
"Most of the people still on the ship are returning here."
 
"How many chose to strike out on their own?"
 
"A quarter of those who survived the crash." Marcus reported as he stared out into the ocean
 
"What happened Marcus?"
 
Marcus bent down and picked up a shell as he casually tossed it out into the ocean, "I'm not sure."
 
"How can we not be sure?"
 
"While the evacuation was getting underway Victoria and I began searching for answers but we couldn’t find any.  We couldn’t even start the computers to get to the logs."
 
"They should have survived the crash."
 
Lifting another shell from the ground Marcus corrected Nathaniel's assumption.  "Physically they did."
 
"Then why won’t they start?"
 
"That's what we don’t know Nathaniel, everything looks good, yet nothing will start."
 
"How is that possible?"
 
"Victoria thinks there is something on the planet that is causing our technology to fail."
 
Turning around to look inland, Nathaniel commented, "It looks so much like home, i wonder what could have caused this."
 
"I would expect that to be the first thing we try and figure out." Marcus answered watching as the last of the little boats returned from the colony ship as is stands out of the ocean
 
"No, the first thing would be trying to survive.  How many of the animals survived the crash?"
 
"None of the ones that were out of storage."
 
"How many were in storage?"
 
"Less than ten percent, and we lost another four percent to the fracturing of the crew."
 
"The Novus didn’t carry just a crew, they also carried colonists.  And some of them don’t want to follow us."
 
"But how else are they going to survive?"
 
Facing his friend Nathaniel gently chided Marcus, "They are colonists, they know the hardaches that come with the territory.  The ones who left us are asking that very question about us, I promise you that."
 
"So what?"
 
"Knowledge is crucial, Marcus.  And right now they have the knowledge that will allow for survival.  So I'm happy we were able to keep some of the colonists here with us."
 
"But we wont be here all that long will we?"
 
"Marcus, let's get back to the camp."
 
"Sure thing." Marcus followed Nathaniel as he marched back towards the main encampment and joined the leaders of the colonists and the scientists.
 
"Have we had any luck getting the radios working?" Nathaniel
 
"No," Ruth replied as she tossed the radio she was working on to the sand behind here
 
Russell looked around hoping not to spread fear or terror as he relayed his findings.  "We have tested every piece fo equipment and every circuit we managed to remove from the Novus."
 
"And?" (Nathaniel)
 
"And nothing, our tools arent even working anymore."
 
"How bad is it?" (Nathaniel)
 
"Welcome to the stone age boys." Talia, another colonist, said in reply
 
"It's bad" Marcus replied
 
"Yeah, but we will survie and we will find a way off this rock one day."
