Last month we witnessed one of Harrison's mad scientist moments, while he was studying a relic.  This month the spotlight shifts back to Sylvia, who last we saw saved the life of her employer.  She pounced on the assassin, a man irate over his sibling's fate before he could launch his attack.  Was her employer's latest act of mercy enough to keep his people satisfied with him?  Follow Sylvia as she explores the city seeking out any danger to her employer.<!-- more --><hr class="clear-both center-fade"/><div class="embedded-image-left">![](/writing/harrison-sylvia/series-01/harrison-sylvia-1.jpg)</div> 
 
Sylvia, responding to a summons, comes to her employer's aid.  Upon her arrival, a jovial Kameron informs her that he will be hosting a grand gala for the people of his kingdom.  Sylvia instantly argues that given his current standing with his people Kameron should reconsider this extravagant display of wealth.  He dismisses her concerns and demands that she does what she is paid to do.  Begrudgingly she consents to keep him alive despite his foolishness.
 
Knowing that she has a lot to prepare, far too little time to do it, she instantly begins chasing down whispers.  She also realizes just how ill-equipped she is to handle her employer's recent challenge, so she decides to rectify that issue.  So among her stops is a friend, who can help her but that help always comes at a price.
