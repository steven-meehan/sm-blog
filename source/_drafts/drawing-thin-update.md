Whenever I finish my initial work on one of my stories, be it a short story or a full-length novel, I can't wait to get feedback on my work.  This was true for _Dead Man's Hand_, the flash fiction I've posted on my blog and to the other tales I've been busy crafting.  So once I finished my initial work on _Drawing Thin_, I immediately started reaching out to people I trusted to give me their honest thoughts.  In fact, I implored them to tell me where I messed up.  Those particular notes mean more to me than the ones that highlight the things I did right.<!-- more -->

If my readers were to spare my feelings, I wouldn't be able to craft a well-rounded story in the end.  As a result, I'm always a little nervous once I hand those readers my manuscripts.  Once handed over to those selected few, all I can do is wait for them to finish reading the work so I can get their collected opinions and observations.  And as I wait for those, I find myself flashing back to my youth as I eagerly wait for Christmas morning to arrive so I can rip into the presents that I will find under the decorated Christmas tree or in and around my stocking.

And I have started to receive feedback from my trusted pre-readers.  The feedback I've gotten so far has been fantastic, and I expect that trend to continue as I receive the last of my feedback.  With each response, I'm getting a clear picture of what needs to be cleaned up and made sharper.  So armed with the concerns and criticisms of my pre-readers, I have already started thinking about how to incorporate their responses into the revision of _Drawing Thin_.

I am entering the final phase of this book's journey to publication, yet to incorporate all of the feedback I am going to have to push back my target publication date.  However, I am still eager to bring this tale to the world and continue the story I began with _Dead Man's Hand_.

Keep an eye here on the blog, for more updates on _Drawing Thin_'s release, including sample chapters once I'm finished with the updates.
