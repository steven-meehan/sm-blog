The King of the Central Kingdom is a capricious tyrant lording his wealth and power over his kingdom.  One day he was listening to the petitions of his people.  The king had been refusing each petitioner in turn.  He was merely following the form as the king waited for the task to be completed.  While he is waiting for a petitioner to address him, the King sees a face that doesn't match the rest of the crowd for a fleeting moment, before becoming lost in the group.

Danger is something the king has become numb to, ever since he employed the best protection available in his kingdom, perhaps across all of the kingdoms, Sylvia.  She is an expert at protecting people, especially those who require a certain amount of discretion thanks to a specific set of abilities.

Yet later on during the petitions that strange face appears again, full of malice and defiance.  The king immediately tries to locate it only to be distracted letting the face disappear into the crowd.  With this face appearing multiple times discover if the king's faith in his protection is justified.
