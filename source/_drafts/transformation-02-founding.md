A couple months after deciding to colonize this world new arguments began to spill out causing a rise in dissention, which in turn required this meeting to try and resolve 

Caitlin, leaned over to Quinn and asked with a whisper, "Is it too late to change our mind?" 

"Yes," he said with the same whisper 

But Caitlin had heard enough so she tapped upon the microphone to get everyone's attention. 

"We are wasting too much time with the debates about reforming the Federation.  While I agree it will become important someday that day is still years off.  We have more important things to consider first, such as how we will get back to colonizing the stars." 

"But we have to know how the worlds will work together!" Someone in the crowd called out 

"I agree with you, but that can be done before we relaunch the colonization ship.  For the moment we need to turn our attention to this world.  We will only thrive if everyone dedicates themselves to this world. 

Our colonists need to focus on their job to supply us with the food we need.  while our scientists can focus on adapting the platforms to be interconnected rather than useless, not to mention new ships to help secure Aurora." 

Quinn stands up and addresses the crown, "You all know that I was not in favor of this plan, but after working with Caitlin I have come to realize that it is the best path we have before us." 

"So what should we do first?" 

Caitlin, "First we need to establish a leader, without a clear voice we will not be able to move forward." 

After a bit of murmuring a cry broke out from the crowd growing stronger moment by moment, "A triumvirate!" 

Caitlin was shocked but she seized the rapid consent, "Very well we shall establish the triumvirate, but for now let us talk of other things that are needed." 

The crowd quickly fractured, and Neither Quinn nor Caitlin could tell what was being discussed because of the sheer number of topics 

Caitlin grabbed Quinn's shoulder and "How are we going to go forward?" 

"Decisions need to be made," Quin answered with eyes that showed he knew what to do 

"Quinn, what are you doing?" 

"Do you trust me?" 

"Normally." 

I'll take it," he said as he tapped the microphone and stood up.  When the crowd quieted down he addressed them, "We will fill the first two seats of the triumvirate right now if you a willing." 

The crowd quickly began applauding the move though Caitlin was nervous. 

"For the first triumvir we will have Caitlin," he said as he pointed to his left and there was a roar of agreement and a stifled objection from Caitlin 

Once again tapping on the microphone he went on, "I will be the second triumvir." And again a chorus of cheers rang out from the crowd 

Once more silencing the crowd Quinn pressed on, "We will have to elect our third triumvir but for the moment I believe Caitlin and I are agreed that certain things need to be done.  For starters we will land the ship in shallow waters so that all will be able to see the symbol that we will return to the stars, 10 years from now.  Second as Caitlin said we will dedicate ourselves to crafting a world that rivaled Laria in every way.  But to do that we will need to have a single minded focus.  Ten years from now we will have platforms that are capable of going to any planet we colonize and we will have ships that travel the stars between them ensuring their safety.  But most importantly we will have a world where everyone has a full belly and a place to sleep." 

A chorus of cheers erupted form the crowd as Caitlin leaned over and asked, "How did you know that would work?" 

"People work better when there is a structure." 

"A structure?" 

"We established a government and the high level tasks that need to be done for our survival, we'll survive." 

"Who will our third triumvir then?" 

"The most senior scientist." 

"Wouldn't it be best to have them working the issue rather than dealing with politics?" 

"No, the most senior scientist will only get in the way of the younger ones striving to do something different." 

"I guess I'll concede to that point." 

"What?" 

"You basically repeated what I said." 

"But i did it as a triumvir." 

"You made yourself a triumvir." 

"I know, come let's start planning out the details."
