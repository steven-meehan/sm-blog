A couple months after leading the cause to settle their new world, Caitlin was amazed at how many arguments were being made.  No one was able to get any work done because of all the uncertainty surrounding the future.  She took a deep breath and wondered why the uncertainty was such a problem now, the future was always uncertain.  But after a moment she understood, in the blink of an eye everything had changed and the fear of that change was running wild on Aurora.
 
Though she hoped that tonight, would be more productive.  Annoyed with the hostility and fear she leaned over to Quinn and asked as she covered her microphone, "Is it too late to change our minds?"  
 
"Yes," he said after he blocked his own mic.  "We made a decision and now we just have to see it through."  
 
Caitlin groaned but she knew he was right.  Taking her hand off the mic she quickly began tapping it to get everyone’s attention.  Once the hall was silent she addressed the latest concern, "We're wasting too much time trying to debate reforms of the Federation.  While I agree with most of the proposals, they are simply not relevant at the moment.  We are still years away from colonizing another world.  As such we need to focus upon things that will impact how quickly we can return to the stars and create a new coalition of worlds."
 
"But before we get there we have to know how the worlds will work together!" Someone in the crowd called out  
 
"I agree with you, in principle." Caitlin said quickly.  But the voice could try and use her agreement against her she went on.  "But for the moment we need to learn how to update the platforms to work independently of Laria.  We also need to develop our new home.  We no longer are backed by a powerful Federation.  As my esteemed college" Caitlin says smoothly as she points to the man at her right.  "Quinn has pointed out and I agree with him that we need new ships to help protect this fledgling coalition.  These are the issues we should be discussing right now and coming to a concessive about.  Not the future plans of that are years away.”
 
Quinn stands up and addresses the crown, "You all know that I was not in favor of this plan, but after working with Caitlin I have come to realize that it is the best path we have before us."  
 
"So what should we do first?"  Asked another nameless voice from the crowd.
 
Caitlin, "First we need to establish leadership, it has become obvious that without a clear voice we will not be able to move forward."  
 
After a bit of murmuring a cry broke out from the crowd growing stronger moment by moment, "A triumvirate!"  
 
Caitlin was shocked but she seized the rapid consent, "Very well we shall establish the triumvirate, but for now let us talk of other things that are needed."  
 
The crowd quickly fractured, and Neither Quinn nor Caitlin could tell what was being discussed because of the sheer number of topics  
 
Caitlin grabbed Quinn's shoulder and "How can we ever march forward?"  
 
"Do you trust me?"  
 
"Normally."  
 
"I'll take it," he said as he tapped the microphone as he stood.  When the crowd quieted down he addressed them meekly, "We will fill the first two seats of the triumvirate right now if you a willing."  
 
The crowd quickly began applauding the move though Caitlin grew even more nervous.  
 
"For the first triumvir we will have Caitlin," he said as he pointed at her, a roar of agreement stifled Caitlin's objections.  She looked at him but he gave her a pained expression as he mouthed, _I'm sorry_.  But he turned back to the crowd silenceing them again before continuing, "And I will become the second triumvir."  And surprisingly to Caitlin another chorus of cheers rang out from the crowd.  
 
Once more silencing the crowd Quinn continued, "We will have to elect our third triumvir but for the moment I believe Caitlin and I are agreed landing the colonization ship in shallow waters.  It will be the ever vigilent symbol that we will return to the stars in ten years.  As Caitlin said we will need to have a single minded focus if we are to surpass Laria, and we will.  But right now we have to ensure that everyone has a full belly and a place to sleep."  
 
A chorus of cheers erupted form the crowd as Caitlin leaned over asking, "How did you know that would work?"  
 
"People work better when there is a structure."  
 
"Structure?"  
 
"We established a government and the high level tasks that need to be done for our survival."  
 
"You assumed power for both of us," Caitlin said with a disapproving glare.
 
"Nonsense, we made the most sense.  Not to mention we are in agreement on the high level issues.  This way we can start getting people moving in the right direction.  That is the important thing," Quinn said fully serious.
 
"And our third triumvir?"
 
"The most senior scientist," Quinn said quickly as if he had been waiting for the question.
 
"Wouldn't it be best to have them working the issue rather than dealing with politics?"  
 
"No," he answered as he gave her a broad smile.  "The most senior scientist will only get in the way of the younger ones.  And those are the ones who will ultimately push us forward towards our future."
 
Shaking her head, Caitlin complained, "You realize that you basically just repeated what I told them."  
 
"Yes," he said with a sly smile spreading across his angular face.  "But I did it as a triumvir."  
 
"You made yourself a triumvir," Caitlin complained.
 
"I know," Quinn said with his largest grin.  As he turned his attention back to the crowd he added, "Come let's start planning out all of the details."
