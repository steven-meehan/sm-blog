Once upon a time, there were two friends, a boy, and a girl, wandering through the snow-covered woods behind one of their homes.  The pair spent so much of their free time in these woods that they knew them better than they knew their homes.  So they were a little surprised when they came across a stream in their wooded and snow-topped playground.  The girl looked at the boy and asked, "Where did this stream come from?"

"I have no idea," the boy replied as he stared at the new stream.  Then he looked over at his friend and said, "But we should cross it and see where it goes.<!-- more -->"

The little girl looked at the stream and replied, "I don't think we can jump it and I don't want to fall into it."

The boy quickly looked around and found a large branch on the ground and grabbed it saying, "I think this will reach the other side."

"Thant's not going to hold our weight."

"No," the boy agreed quickly, but he pointed at another branch a few feet away.  "But we could lash a bunch of them together to make a bridge so we can cross."

"And you just happen to have some rope?"

The boy smiled as he pulled down the sleeve of his coat exposing a colorful bracelet.  "I have my paracord bracelets, so yeah I should have enough rope and ill test the bridge first."

The girl smiled as she looked from the snow-covered branches littering their side of the bank, "Let's do it."

So the children began to scour their side of the bank for branches that would bridge the stream.  Each time they found a branch that they thought might work the tried to reach it out to the other side of the stream.  Some fell short of the far bank and were plucked from their hands while others touched the opposite bank.  And each time one of their branches touched that distant ground they heard a thud that was far too loud for their gentle touch, yet they ignored it as a trick of the minds.

Once they found ten branches of sufficient length, they pulled them back to their side of the stream, and the boy removed his paracord bracelets and began lashing them together.  He quickly began to lash the branches together on one side, then he moved and bound the other side of the make-shift bridge.  Then the pair lifted their bridge carrying it to the stream carefully laying the one edge along the far bank.  Then with a smile, they dropped the side they were still holding upon their side of the bridge and hear a thunderclap echo from the forest.

They spun around in circles trying to locate what had caused that noise but could find nothing.  Finally, the boy offered his friend a half smile and put his foot upon the bridge, and they both heard a strange and unearthly menacing voice cry out, "Who dares cross my bridge?"

Again the children shared a look together wondering if they should leave, but the boy gave a sheepish smile as he moved his foot farther along the bridge and an arm shot from the still surface of the water and enveloping the far side of the bridge, as that strange voice asked, "Who dares cross my bridge?"

The girl reached for the boy's arm and gave it a gentle tug, but before she could pull him from the bank, the arm was joined with the rest of the things body.  And a sizeable ungainly creature stood on the far side with water dripping from its mishappen body and patchwork hair.  As the massive thing snarled at them, both children gasped in fear.

The creature took a ponderously slow step as it snarled, "Who dares to cross my bridge?!"

Instinctively the boy took a step back as his friend cried out, "We have to get away from here."  Yet one of the boy's hands brushed his pocket knife, and he knew what he needed to do.  He pulled the pocket knife from its pouch and immediately began cutting the lashings.  Yet the creature kept moving closer to them one ponderous step after another.  Finally, the boy was able to slice the rope, and he began to spread the branches apart, just as the thing's leg came down upon a single branch.

Since the monster's weight was too much for that single branch, it snapped, and the monster's foot broke the stream's surface.  A moment later the rest of the creature's body fell upon the spreading branches snapping each in turn, and the thing fell into the stream.  The boy stood and edged closer to the stream looking into it, and he saw the thing sinking away from the surface, but it made one last lunge for him.  The boy fell backward, and the girl rushed to his side.  She helped the boy up before looking back at the stream to find it gone as if it had never been there.
