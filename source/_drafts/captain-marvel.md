ever since the last end credit scene of infinity war when we were teased with captain marvel's appearance we have been waiting to discover how that pager came into existence, and we recently got our wish

the story, while an origin story albeit an after the fact rediscovery of her origin, fresh take on the spin

begrudging buddy film with Danvers and fury, since it starts with him trying to arrest her

was billed as a direct prelude into endgame much as Ragnarok was to infinity wars, (is done wonderfully) [no spoilers]

billed as captain marvel's first solo movie but so much more it is also an origin for nick fury

we see a new side of fury, a more trusting side and it was fun to see his character arc from an open individual to a more cynical and clandestine individual we know and love

the movie flows well enough to keep me interested with all of the data dumps

The dumps are done in critical points of the movie 

the visual cues were fantastic

the music paired with the movie perfectly enhancing the performance of the actors

nostalgia factor through the roof, computer references were my favorite part of the film, blockbuster video, RadioShack, payphones

heard complaints that Brie Larson's performance was wooden, but let's take a moment and examine the first moments of the film, she is fighting with Jude Law as Yon-Rogg and he flat out tells her that emotion is the enemy and she needs to suppress it, or it will get in the way, so the performance fits with the character

there was a little Deus Ex Machina with her being able to hijack phones with her advanced technology to perform tasks that were ridiculous but helped the story unfold

the comedy again is well placed (an example of fury asking is she can fly the ship and her response of maybe yes or no question, peeking under the cloth of the autopsied Skrull)

the cast appeared to have good chemistry

excited to see Coulson and the forging of the friendship between him and fury

goose, the cat that has been in so much of the promos for the movie is used as comedic relief in tandem with fury for much of the film, though early on he was recognized as a Flerken
