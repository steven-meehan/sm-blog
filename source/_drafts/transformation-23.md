As Quinn’s door opened, someone emerged from the shadows and leaned against the frame, lifting a pad to obscure his face. “Do not overreact when you read this.”

Quinn placed the stopper in the carafe and carried his drink to his desk. “Personally, I’d get tired of repeating that line before every report.”

The man shook his head as he continued brandishing the small device. “Unfortunately, I know you and how you react when you hear unpleasant news.” He shrugged, tapping the pad against his hip. “And like always, I’m bearing an unfortunate update, so don’t shoot.”

Quinn slipped into his seat as an eyebrow climbed up his forehead. With a sip, he waved his courier to approach. He lowered the glass and tapped it against the wooden surface. As the agent sauntered forward, Quinn’s chin fell into his open palm as he continued tapping a march in time with the messenger’s stride. When the individual stopped in front of the desk, Quinn raised the glass to his nose and took a deep breath. “Dorian, can’t you ever bring me pleasant news?”

A sigh rushed from Dorian’s lips as his hand swallowed his face. “There’s a reason for that.”

“After the day I’ve had, I need cheering up.” With a sigh, Quinn pressed his glass to his temple, while his free hand fell, thudding against the desk. He sipped the pale liquid and bit his lip. “I miss the simpler days.”
