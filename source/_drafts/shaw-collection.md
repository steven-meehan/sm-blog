Daniel and Rachel are pacing around the wine cellar. Daniel is surveying the people there while Cecil is studying the racks of wine.  She's tracing a rack letting her fingers wipe dust from the bottles and she stopped when she saw a distinctive bottle.  "Daniel," she said as her eyes threatened to leap from her head.  "I can't believe they have a bottle of..."
"Not now, Rachel," Daniel chastised as he grabbed the wrist before she could touch the bottle of wine that caught her eye.
"But Daniel," Rachel pleaded.
He immediately but a finger against her lips while he activated his communications with the rest of his crew.  "Harlan, do you see the target," Daniel whispered.
"Target is heading down," Harlan responded.
Daniel jerked his head towards the door and inquired, "Cecil are you and Franco ready?"
"Box one is secured," Cecil said shortly.
"Box two is secured," Franco answered.  "Though Cecil why are you so sour?"
"Don't ask him that," Daniel said as he pulled Rachel into an embrace to study the entrance from over her shoulder.
"I don't like our employer," Cecil complained.  "Why can't I complain about it?"
"We're getting paid quite handsomely," Laurie noted.  "But the wing is smooth, captain."
"Excellent," Daniel whispered into the comm.  "And all you do is complina about our employer."
"I do not," Cecil objected without much feling.  "Are you sure about this plan Daniel?"
"Yeah," Daniel retored with a muffled scoff.  Then Daniel turned Rachel around and silenced his comms.  He leaned over and murmured into her ear.  "Did you mark your bottles?"
"Yes," she said with a frown.  She tried to turn it into a smile as she pleaded in a whisper, "I could switch one of the tags."
Daniel sook his head and hugged her as he whispered, "I have eyes on Wayne Pashar.  Do you remember what you need to do?"
"Yes," Rachel retorted as she glared back at the wine rack.
"Daniel pulled her closer to him and said, "Do not try and grab the wine."
Rachel tore her eyes away from the fancy bottle and pouted, "Daniel we're here already and we're..."
Daniel shook his head and put his finger back on her lips.  He put his forehead against hers and spoke so only she could hear him.  "I know you are not too fond of what we do, Rachel, but please don't advertise what we're doing."
"Why did you bring me?"  She asked as she wrapped her hands together behind his neck.
A chuckle escaped Daniel, "Because of what you just did, Rachel."
"My hands?"
"It's impossible to fake some of these motions that you know so well," Daniel replied as he stepped away from her and activated his comms.  "Are you ready?"
She almost tore his arm loose when she tugged at him practically yelling, "You owe me three bottles of wine."
Daniel's eyes furrowed as he fought to put a snarl on his face, "Why do I bother trying to take you anywhere?  This is all you ever do."
Rachel stalked towards the exit bringing her closer to Wayne as she spat over her shoulder, "I shouldn't have expected anything different."
Daniel began walking towards Rachel and Wayne as he murmured, "Now."
After two steps the ceiling began to crack and large pits of concrete began plummeting to the ground.  AS the rubble fell the patrons tried to fun for the exits, but Daniel and Rachel clogged the main exit while Cecil and Franco secured the two alternate exits form the cellar.  Guests screamed as they ineffectually tried yanking doors open or to interrupt the bickering Daniel and Rachel.  Moments after Wayne grabbed at Daniel and forcibly spun him around, a pair of metallic bodies collided with the floor with a sickening crunch of the concrete floor.
As the robots stood screams filled the room, and the larger robot lifted his weapon and fired into the ceiling.  "Silence.  No body move."
Every throat fell silent as the smaller robot leapt into motion.  Within moments everyone was bound and dropped into a pile and the larger one collected five bottles of wine from the racks.  He slipped a case off his back and put the bottles into the case and then tossed it over his shoulder.  The robot grabbed Wayne who shouted, "How dare you!"
The robot sent electricity into the struggling Wayne.  The body went limp and the robot tossed him over his shoulder and grabbed Daniel by his shirt.  While the smaller yanked Rachel up by the scruff of her neck.  Both robots went through the cellar's main exit.  The smaller robot tossed a grenade down the stairs before he dragged Rachel to the exterior wall and planted a small charge.  It strolled back towards his compatriot and the charge detonated blowing a hole in the wall.
Security flooded into the hallway as another of the small grenades detonated filling the room with gas that forced the security into unconsciousness.  The two robots walked out of the hole and immediately rose into the sky as a small craft passed overhead.  As the craft climbed into the sky the robots and the people were pulled inside just before the craft left the atmosphere.
Daniel's hand crept for his comms and switched to a separate channel, "Laurie the pickup could have been smoother."
"The bots didn't complain, captain," Laurie chirped.
"How soon till we randevu with the Scythe?" Daniel inquired as he walked over to Wayne's unconscious form.
"Bout twelve hours," Laurie answered.
"Good," Daniel said as he woke the fallen Wayne.  When the man's eyes opened Daniel apologized, "Sorry, Mr. Pashar but Mr. Glazov wants to have a candid conversation with you.
