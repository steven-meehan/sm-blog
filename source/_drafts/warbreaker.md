Brandon Sanderson is a marvel at crafting his tales.  Be it from his majestic Mistborn trilogy to the epic begninings of the Stormlight Archives.  Each of these cosmere tales fits together, though I'm not quite sure how they do yet, but they can be enjoyed all on there own just fine.  After i consumed the Mistborn trilogy, my first exposure to Sanderson's work, I looked far and wide for his work.  I quickly found his tale of Warbreaker.  This is another one of his cosmere worlds and as with each tale there are mutiple storylines running thoughout.

Each of the major characters has their strengths and their weaknesses, something that I always enjoy in his works.
