Unfortunately, the ending of this book was like a slap to the face. Books should always have a begining, a middle and an end, but with *Blood Is Thicker* Orlando Sanchez decided to leave us with several plot threads flapping in the wind. Presumably he's going to wrap them up in the next installment of his series, , but I'm not entirly sure if I'm willing to be strung along. That being said, I'm no longer chomping at the bit to buy the book.

When I found [*Blood Is Thicker*](https://www.audible.com/pd/Blood-Is-Thicker-Audiobook/B08629JNZM) available on Audible, I pounced on it eager to consume the next story in the [Montague & Strong Case Files](https://www.audible.com/series/Montague-Strong-Case-Files-Series-Audiobooks/B07CCMN7ZW). With the first two books in this series, Orlando Sanchez crafted a beautiful world with characters so engaging and fascinating that I couldn’t wait to pick up this installment. With each word, I wrapped the narrative around me like a comfortable blanket, letting the plot unfurl in my mind.<!-- more -->

As with the previous installments, our detectives are tossed into the deep end almost immediately. And this time they’re greeted by the leader of the Dark Council, though she’s suffering from a potentially fatal wound. And while Simon and Tristan are seeking the answers to the attack on Michiko, Tristan’s use of a void vortex in [*Full Moon Howl*](https://www.audible.com/pd/Full-Moon-Howl-Audiobook/B07BNSWCT9) was not overlooked by his old order. And unlike a friendly customer at a deli, the mages seeking to capture Tristan refuse to take their number and get in line for a chance to capture their wayward mage.

The main issue that I’ve had with this series rears its ugly head again, Simon’s inability to die. Throughout the entire book, many references are made to his unique situation, and I’m never genuinely am afraid that he’s ever in any actual danger. Even the author’s attempt to make us fearful for Simon’s life fall short, though we get some glimpses into what makes our protagonist so unique.

As the last words of the novel lingered in my mind, I remembered the last sentence of my review of [*Full Moon Howl*](~/archives/2020/02/11/full-moon-howl):

> But the series is too good to avoid while I wait for the Audible version of the book…

Unfortunately, the ending of this book was like a slap to the face. Books should always have a beginning, a middle and an end And while I understand leaving certain aspects for later novels, somethign that is given almost as much weight as the primary plot should not be ignored as the book comes to a close, a fact that Orlando Sanchez ignores as he leaves several plot threads flapping in the wind with *Blood Is Thicker*. Presumably, he will wrap them up in the next installment of his series, [Silver Clouds Dirty Sky](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078XJ8W9T), but I’m not eager to get strung along, despite the gripping characters and narrative. With that said, the characters are compelling enough that when the next one is available on Audible and if I have a spare credit I might pick it up.
