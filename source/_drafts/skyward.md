Brandon Sanderson is a fantastic author and the arcing story he is telling in his cosmere universe is breathtaking.  But he does not spend all of his time living in that universe, and as such his faithful readers are treated to tales outside of that story.  One such story is Skyward.  This particular tale centers around the life and struggles of Spin.  She is a child who has a simple dream to follow her father's footsteps and become a starship pilot to help her people in their struggle against their enemy. 
 
As with any of Sanderson's work, Skyward is a terrific read.  Unlike the rest of his work the protagonist takes a little while for me to get behind and root for.  In the beginning of the story she has a chip on her shoulder the size of Mount Everest.  And she is ready to attack anyone that gets in her way.  Normally I enjoy a snarky character who strives to endure a tremendous challenge, but Spin struck me as too childish for the role she reached for. 
 
However once she began to settle down and grow, the pettiness of her character dwindled and she began to flourish as a character.  One of the things that I love about Sanderson's work is that his supporting cast are always as flushed out as his protagonists.  Skyward is no exception, from her childhood friend Rig, to her eventual flight leader she affectionately nicknamed Jerkface, each has a rich backstory that always remains just out of focus but tantalizing.  The story would never have reached its height without their assistance. 
 
With sports there are always a handful of moments that prove to be critical to the outcome of the game.  It's amazing how often you can look to sports and see an allegory of life.  Throughout a person's life there will be a handful of moments that prove to be crucial in shaping that life.  Well Spin's life is no exception, and at each of those moments her dedication, perseverance and an enormous amount of luck prove critical in giving her exactly what she needs at the crucial time, right up to the climax of the novel. 
 
I can honestly say that I rarely see the ending coming with the vast majority of Sanderson's works.  Though with that said, Skyward's ultimate destination did not entirely blindside me this time.  There was a single twist that while not perfectly formed in my mind before its revelation made sense given the tone of the rest of the novel.  While I selfishly want Sanderson to focus on his cosmere, I cannot get enough of that universe, Skyward was a fantastic story once I managed to get past Spin's chippy pettiness. 
 
And while I would rather see his next novel be a cosmere one, I will absolutely pick up Skyward's sequel, (insert name) when it comes out in October later this year.
