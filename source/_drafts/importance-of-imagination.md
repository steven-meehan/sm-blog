Why are children able to keep themselves entertained with the simplest of house hold things?  I'll look to my daughter picking up a cardboard box and ask her what shes doing only to be told that she is playing with a boat, or a plane or something else.  That pure unadulturated imagination powers all of their play.  It is amazing when you stop and think about it.  They are able to take the ordinary and find the extrordinary.

Unfortunately this is something that far too many people lose as they grow up.
