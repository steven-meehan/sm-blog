Looking back through old pictures, I remembered some of the things my daughter would play with. Some times it was something as simple as a cardboard box.  I watched her play with itI remember the times when my daughter picked up a cardboard box and started playing with it. Every time I would ask her what she was doing I heard different things, from sailing on a boat to flying on a plane. That pure unadulterated imagination powered her play. It's amazing how powerful an imagination is when you stop and think about it. The ability to take the ordinary and find the extraordinary is nothing short of a miracle.<!-- more -->

While I have an active imagination, I'm sad to see that spark of creativity dim in my little girl. For someone who can sit down and stare into the woods and see a story unfold, it's hard to see a weakening imagination. So, I encourage her to do things that will help her imagination grow. Life has a way of eroding an imagination all on its own. As much as I don't want to admit it, my own imagination has been tempered by age and the demands of life. While I'm a little biased, I;m a firm believer that a healthy imagination is as important to a healthy life or a clean bill of health. Our imagination is what allows us to escape the daily grind of our adult lives.

There are plenty of days when the stress of life begins to wear on me. And that is when I unleash my imagination, and I find that my anxiety wanes. The outlet my imagination uses isn't always one of my stories. Sometimes it's something as simple as cracking open a good book and letting it lead me on an incredible journey. Even watching a good movie or television show can help jumpstart my imagination and let it run wild. And no matter how I allow my imagination to run free I find that I'm happier and healthier. So, go out and flex the muscles of your imagination and feel the stress of your life melt away.
