My final Patreon exclusive story for October came up as a political satire. Sitting down at my desk, I mulled over what I could write about but kept coming up short of an issue to feature in the story. When I couldn’t think of something, I reached back to the past catalog of NYC Midnight’s Flash Fiction Challenges and found a prompt. With the skeleton of a story in one hand, I still needed to flush out the rest of it. Though I needed something political to feature with the restrictions of the prompt.<!-- more --> After plenty of soul searching, I reached an issue that I figured might prove full of potential. I dove into the rumblings around a potential prohibition on vaping.
